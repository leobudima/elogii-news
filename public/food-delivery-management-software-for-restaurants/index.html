        <div class="content mb-5">
          <p>There’s no doubt about it. Delivery is changing the way we consume our food.</p>
<p>And it isn’t a new concept.</p>
<p>From making a phone call to ordering food online from your favourite restaurant, meal delivery has enabled us to get meals brought straight to our doorstep.</p>
<p>Now, we can even do it by tapping an app on our phone. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>But this is causing a lot of disruption in the food industry.</p>
<p>Bricks-and-mortar restaurants that were once reluctant to offer delivery as part of their service now accept the fact that it is the way of the future.</p>
<p>And they are not alone anymore.</p>
<p>Food delivery has also enabled a completely new business model to emerge - dark kitchens.</p>
<p>Together with dedicated food-delivery platforms, it is causing a gastronomic revolution and changing the status quo.</p>
<p>But as food delivery becomes a necessity in the industry, both standard restaurants, and dark kitchens have to turn to technology to maintain their presence in this dynamic market.</p>
<p>Enter food delivery management software.</p>
<p>An innovative solution for the food delivery supply chain that can help businesses on both sides of the isle achieve their goals.</p>
<p>(But more on that later)</p>
<p>Right now, let’s see what is driving this change.</p>
<h2 id="consumers-are-reshaping-the-food-delivery-landscape">Consumers are reshaping the food delivery landscape.</h2>
<p>When it comes to their meals, consumers want it delivered to their doorstep now more than ever.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/100/online-food-delivery/worldwide#market-globalRevenue"><strong>statistics say</strong></a> there are <strong>1,231.9 million food delivery users</strong> in the world in 2020. And this trend is only going to continue.</p>
<p>As more millennials come of age and factors like <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/the-state-of-delivery-in-time-of-the-coronavirus/"><strong>the outbreak of the coronavirus</strong></a> prompt more people to use delivery, that number will swell.</p>
<p>The current <strong>25% year-over-year growth</strong> of the food delivery industry supports this claim.</p>
<p>As does the revenue forecast for 2024, which states the market will rise to over <strong>$182 billion</strong>.</p>
<p>And the reason behind this growth is convenience.</p>
<p>That’s why more and more consumers are using their apps to order food.</p>
<p><strong>An average person relies on two food delivery apps to order a meal at least three times per month.</strong></p>
<p>Forecasts predict that by 2024 the number of users who rely on platform-to-consumer delivery and restaurant-to-consumer delivery will be the same at <strong>965.8 million</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/rsz_number_of_food_delivery_users.png" alt="platform-to-consumer vs. restaurant-to-consumer delivery" title="Number of food delivery users of platform-to-consumer vs. restaurant-to-consumer delivery"></p>
<p>And while this is dividing the landscape, it’s also providing ample opportunity for businesses that are willing to accept this change.</p>
<p>Those that can offer their food through both channels (<strong>dedicated food platforms</strong> and <strong>private websites or apps</strong>) are the ones that look to gain the most.</p>
<p>So for restaurants and dark kitchens that want to tap into this consumer base, <strong>on-demand food</strong> delivery is the only way to reach this goal.</p>
<p>But this doesn’t come with its own set of unique problems.</p>
<h2 id="on-demand-food-delivery-is-a-challenge">On-demand food delivery is a challenge.</h2>
<p>Offering direct-to-consumer delivery is a difficult undertaking at best, both inside and outside the kitchen.</p>
<p>For restaurants that are yet to enter the game, it means embracing the concept and creating a system from scratch that can support it.</p>
<p>For dark kitchens and on-demand food platforms, it’s an uphill battle to win over customers and make them accept the new way of doing things.</p>
<p>But for everyone in the food delivery industry, it means upholding <strong>a high quality of food and service standard without sacrificing price or profit</strong>.</p>
<p>And this is where many problems appear because consumers are always looking for faster, cheaper, and better to get their food.</p>
<h3 id="1-providing-faster-food-delivery">#1 Providing faster food delivery.</h3>
<p>When it comes to speed, time is of the essence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usfoods.com/our-services/business-trends/2019-food-delivery-statistics.html"><strong>According to statistics</strong></a>, <strong>58% of consumers</strong> are not willing to wait more than 40 minutes for their delivery.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/1.jpg" alt="best wait time for food delivery" title="Acceptable wait times for food delivery"></p>
<p>This means not just increasing the efficiency of the staff that prepares the food but improving food order management, fulfilment, and creating a suitable delivery network that can support it.</p>
<p><strong>The biggest complaint food delivery customers (17%) make is that their food isn’t warm or fresh enough on arrival.</strong></p>
<p>While we won’t go into the kitchen, faster food delivery and optimized drop-off can certainly help in the matter.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it also means you have to be near your customers.</p>
<p>While <strong>79% of consumers</strong> still choose delivery over takeout if your restaurant is 3km away, the further you are the far less likely they are to order food from you.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/4.jpg" alt="shortest distance for food delivery vs. takeout" title="Differences in distance between delivery and takeout"></p>
<p>That’s because customers relate distance to a slower delivery.</p>
<p>And when only <strong>one in four people</strong> are prepared to wait an hour or more, you will need to overcome this challenge by removing those concerns.</p>
<p>One way is to create a supply chain that can match <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-improve-last-mile-delivery-when-demand-exceeds-your-capacity/"><strong>capacity with demand</strong></a>. The other is to provide a better service.</p>
<h3 id="2-improving-the-quality-of-your-service">#2 Improving the quality of your service.</h3>
<p><strong>Six out of seven complaints</strong> that irritate your customers involve some level of mismanaging service quality.</p>
<p>That’s over <strong>70% of the complaints</strong> customers have with your service.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/3.jpg" alt="reasons for customer complaints with food delivery" title="Biggest reasons for customer complaints"></p>
<p><strong>Businesses that can keep these concerns at a minimum can win over customers even at the cost of a slower delivery.</strong></p>
<p>Getting everyone involved in the delivery of your food on the same page is the first step to achieve this.</p>
<p>The staff that receives orders has to have clear lines of communication with the delivery team.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they also need access to the kitchen to relate customer demands.</p>
<p>But to really improve service you need to let customers voice the concerns they have with your delivery.</p>
<p>Allowing customers the ability to rate the quality of the service is a keystone solution to finding out all of its pitfalls, especially when <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/30/746600105/1-in-4-food-delivery-drivers-admit-to-eating-your-food#:~:text=via%20Getty%20Images-,A%20study%20conducted%20by%20US%20Foods%20found%20that%20nearly%2030,food%20from%20their%20customer's%20order.&amp;text=Drivers%20who%20reported%20working%20for,a%20median%20age%20of%2030."><strong>1 in 4 delivery drivers admit to eating customers’ food</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Another way to improve customer experience and relieve some of their tension is to <strong>give customers greater control over their delivery</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, providing customers with a tracking link when they order food lets them stay on top of the whereabouts of their delivery and ETAs.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s worth establishing <strong>a direct line of communication between the customer and the deliverer</strong>.</p>
<p>Not only does this improve customer satisfaction, but it also reduces missed food deliveries.</p>
<h3 id="3-ensuring-the-correct-price-of-your-delivery">#3 Ensuring the correct price of your delivery.</h3>
<p>Food delivery is a numbers game.</p>
<p>And while it comes at a substantial cost, there is one thing going in your favour.</p>
<p><strong>Customers don’t mind spending money on delivery.</strong></p>
<p>The only thing you have to determine is how much are they willing to pay for your delivery still to turn in a profit.</p>
<p>But keeping customers (and staff) satisfied with the price of your service isn’t easy.</p>
<p>According to statistics, customers are willing to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-07-30/survey-people-willing-to-pay-more-for-food-delivery"><strong>pay on average $8.5 for their delivery</strong></a>, including the delivery fee, service fee, and tip.</p>
<p>But if you want to create a truly cost-efficient food delivery, you need to go beyond price.</p>
<p><strong>You need to optimize your operations to minimize cost and maximize output performance.</strong></p>
<p>That’s where <strong>delivery management software</strong> comes in.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-delivery-management-software-solve-this">How does delivery management software solve this?</h2>
<p><strong>Delivery management software</strong> is the ultimate end-to-end solution for delivery.</p>
<p>While it is a special tool that can help you attain measurable results, it’s also industry-specific.</p>
<p>It works differently when you want to <strong>manage field service</strong>, from when you want to know <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-can-retailers-survive-and-compete-in-the-age-of-amazon-delivery/"><strong>how to compete with Amazon</strong></a>, to when you want to improve your food delivery.</p>
<p>And we think that’s super important.</p>
<p>You could even make a case that it functions like food delivery or restaurant delivery management software.</p>
<p>A unique system in its own right that <strong>meets the specific needs of food delivery</strong>.</p>
<p>But why is it so great?</p>
<p>That has a lot to do with how it solves the above-mentioned challenges of on-demand food delivery.</p>
<h3 id="an-end-to-end-solution-tailored-to-restaurants-and-dark-kitchens">An end-to-end solution tailored to restaurants and dark kitchens.</h3>
<p><strong>Food delivery software for restaurants</strong> and dark kitchens takes a holistic approach to planning, tracking, organizing and executing delivery across the supply chain.</p>
<p>In other words, from the moment the meal is ordered, down to when the deliverer hands it to the customer, and beyond.</p>
<p>A system like <a href="https://elogii.com/"><strong>eLogii</strong></a> takes <strong>a platform approach</strong> to the problem.</p>
<p>This allows you to integrate with any tool vital for your eatery.</p>
<p>For example, a temperature monitoring app that maintains the freshness of your food, or an order management system you use to receive and send out orders.</p>
<p>On the other hand, delivery management software is also modulated.</p>
<p>It contains all of the tools you need to increase the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of your food delivery.</p>
<p>From <strong>route optimization software</strong> components to <strong>delivery scheduling</strong> and <strong>tracking</strong>, down to a <strong>delivery app for drivers</strong> - it’s all built into the software for food delivery.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you need to take it all. You can choose different plans tailored to your needs or hand-select components for your delivery.</p>
<h3 id="its-a-cost-effective-solution">It’s a cost-effective solution.</h3>
<p>You would think that all of those capabilities would cost you a lot of money.</p>
<p>But you would be wrong.</p>
<p>Unlike legacy solutions that require a hefty upfront investment, this kind of multi-restaurant delivery software is pay-as-you-go at a low annual monthly fee.</p>
<p>All thanks to the <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/adopting-the-cloud-first-approach-to-delivery-logistics/" title="adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics"><strong>cloud-first approach to delivery logistics</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This is useful when you want to increase efficiency without investing too much money.</p>
<p>Enhanced usability means faster adoption.</p>
<p>Unlike other solutions that appear on the delivery management software market, it’s extremely straightforward and easy to use.</p>
<p>Food delivery logistics software comes with a dashboard for your dispatchers and order managers. And a delivery app for drivers and delivery agents.</p>
<p>While the dashboard simplifies operations by relying on familiar actions, like <strong>drag and drop</strong>, the delivery app resembles other smartphone apps people use outside of the workplace.</p>
<p><strong>That can cut the learning curve significantly and reduce the time it takes your team to adopt it, without sacrificing functionality.</strong></p>
<p>And the faster you integrate any new piece of technology into your existing operations, the less money you are losing.</p>
<h3 id="a-feature-rich-environment-increases-transparency-and-flexibility">A feature-rich environment increases transparency and flexibility.</h3>
<p>Agility is a hallmark of the fast-paced food delivery industry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Want to know how to <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/agile-delivery-operations/" title="build an agile delivery operation"><strong>build an agile delivery operation</strong></a>? Follow the link.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>One way meal delivery management software achieves it is through greater visibility over the delivery process.</strong></p>
<p>For example, the dashboard lets your stationary team track each delivery in real-time.</p>
<p>You can use that information to auto-assign orders based on the nearest or best agent so that when a deliverer arrives the delivery is ready for pick-up.</p>
<p>Food orders not being ready has been a major complaint by <strong>52% of the delivery personnel</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Optimizing pick-up lets you reduce their pain, which means you retain a happier workforce.</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, it also lets you maximize their performance output and boost <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/7-key-metrics-in-delivery-logistics-to-measure-for-success/" title="key metrics in delivery logistics"><strong>key metrics in delivery logistics</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Gaining insight into <strong>driver location</strong>, <strong>vehicle capacity</strong>, and <strong>ETAs</strong> to and from drop-off, lets you better plan and schedule deliveries as they arrive.</p>
<p>It also means you can combine that knowledge with the route optimization capabilities to batch deliveries together and <strong>increase the speed of delivery while reducing waste at the same time</strong>.</p>
<p>From a business perspective, this saves you a lot of resources while raking in maximum profit.</p>
<p>And when it’s time to scale your delivery operation, you can do it with much greater flexibility since there is virtually <strong>no limit to how many deliveries, orders, or drivers the system can support</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="meeting-customer-expectations-head-on">Meeting customer expectations head-on.</h3>
<p>As much as attracting new customers is important, <strong>retaining recurring customers is far more critical for restaurants and dark kitchens.</strong></p>
<p>If you can offer a food delivery that makes them feel cared for, they will repay the kindness by recommending your business to other customers.</p>
<p>That’s why you need to provide them with a great experience from the moment they place their order.</p>
<p>And here is where delivery management software can help you achieve that goal.</p>
<p>First off, <strong>taking advantage of each optimizing opportunity shortens the waiting time.</strong></p>
<p>This helps you achieve the 30 minutes or less goal for each food delivery.</p>
<p>Beyond that, automating the entire food delivery process means <strong>you can integrate it with multiple channels while managing each order from one central hub.</strong></p>
<p>From dedicated food platforms and apps to phone calls, this makes it convenient for customers to order their meals from you regardless of how they want to do it.</p>
<p>Another key feature of delivery management software is that it lets you <strong>open a direct line of communication to and from your customers.</strong></p>
<p>For example, after you assign an order to a delivery agent, the software can automatically send tracking codes to customers or use alerts to notify customers about the ETA.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the delivery app lets drivers directly communicate with customers so they can provide more precise information about their time of arrival.</p>
<p>A driver can simply message customers and let them know he is en route or provide them with a more accurate drop-off time.</p>
<p>Drivers can also use the app to check information about the task, such as the <strong>customer’s personal data</strong>, <strong>delivery location</strong>, or <strong>type of order</strong>, reducing the chance of mix-ups, late or missed deliveries.</p>
<p>At drop-off, both the driver and customer don’t have to waste any time manually filling out receipts.</p>
<p>Instead, they can use the built-in <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/electronic-proof-of-delivery-epod-how-does-it-improve-logistics-operations/" title="electronic proof of delivery"><strong>electronic proof of delivery</strong></a> to confirm a successful delivery.</p>
<p>On the off chance that the delivery doesn’t arrive, or the customer is unsatisfied with the delivery service, they can voice their concerns via <strong>the internal rating system</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s a far less painful way of letting customers vent their dissatisfaction than say, social media.</p>
<p>At the same time, it provides you with a source of feedback both about your service and delivery team.</p>
<p>This kind of multi-level customer service is the only way to win over customers in the age of where they hold all the power.</p>
<p>But for on-demand food delivery to work, restaurants and dark kitchens also have to keep a close eye on cost, speed, and output, not to mention optimizing for greater performance.</p>
<p>Having a system like delivery management software is proving to be a key tool when you want to achieve those goals.</p>
