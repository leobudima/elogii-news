        <div class="content mb-5">
          <p>If you want to know how to improve your delivery operations, you should first understand these last-mile delivery challenges.</p>
<p>In order to understand the challenges of last-mile delivery, you should first understand what last-mile delivery really means.</p>
<p>Basically, the last-mile is the last leg of the delivery process.</p>
<p>Naturally, every delivery process starts from the distribution centre or hub and ends at the customer&rsquo;s doorsteps.</p>
<p>The last-mile delivery can vary from a few blocks to 50 or sometimes even 100 miles.</p>
<p>Over time the internet has transformed traditional retail business, and we all know it as e-commerce.</p>
<p>That also brought along a change in customer&rsquo;s shopping habits.</p>
<p>Nowadays, everyone wants their delivery as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, with 2020 being the craziest year so far, it became even more challenging for enterprises to meet logistics operations in the last mile.</p>
<p>No matter what, delivery agents need to be beyond the challenges of last-mile logistics.</p>
<p>Take a look at the top 9 challenges of last-mile delivery.</p>
<h2 id="1-consumer-behaviour">#1 Consumer behaviour</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start this list with the most obvious challenge.</p>
<p>You have probably noticed that <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-great-consumer-shift-ten-charts-that-show-how-us-shopping-behavior-is-changing"><strong>consumer habits and behaviours have changed</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The reason for this is the fast development of <strong>new technologies</strong>.</p>
<p>Consumers are forgetting all about traditional channels.</p>
<p>E-commerce shopping gives customers a chance to compare several products at the same time from the comfort of their home.</p>
<p>For example, you may have noticed how companies are <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/upselling-and-cross-selling-with-delivery/" title="upselling and cross-selling with delivery"><strong>upselling and cross-selling with delivery</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Last-mile distribution</strong> ends up as a necessary part of the global supply chain, because of the change in consumers' behaviour.</p>
<p>Their expectations are higher than ever.</p>
<p><strong>They are not only demanding in terms of quality but also in terms of product differentiation, as well as customization.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Delivery time</strong> is something that has completely changed, as well.</p>
<p>Waiting “from 5 to 7 business days” for a package is a thing of the past. The modern consumer wants everything now.</p>
<p>In fact, fast and free shipping is the main reason <strong>79.8% of people shop on Amazon</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/statistic_id670499_key-factors-for-us-users-to-shop-via-amazon-2020.jpg" alt="last-mile-delivery-consumer-preferences-amazon" title="Why people use Amazon delivery"></p>
<p>For most retailers, this is probably one of your biggest challenges. Especially, when you want to know <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-compete-with-amazon-delivery/" title="How to compete with Amazon delivery"><strong>how to compete with Amazon delivery</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Things are looking up, though.</p>
<p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, people have become more patient.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://footwearnews.com/2020/business/retail/scalefast-report-shoppers-brand-flexible-delivery-patient-1203005178/"><strong>consumers are more tolerant of delivery delays</strong></a> but also show less brand loyalty in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>It stands to reason that if you can minimize delays, you might win over customers this year.</strong></p>
<p>So, companies need to re-design and re-think their last-mile delivery strategy and incorporate different <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-tactics-to-grow-operations/"><strong>delivery tactics to grow operations</strong></a>.</p>
<p>They need to make sure that online services are both profitable and agile in order to be appreciated by consumers.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The change in consumers' behaviour leads us to the problem of outdated technology.</p>
<h3 id="outdated-technology">Outdated Technology</h3>
<p>Even though we are living in the modern digital world, <strong>almost half of all distribution, delivery, and transportation companies admit their technology is outdated.</strong></p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the impact of outdated technology on their organizations?</p>
<p>Actually, outdated technology can cause you to lose customers.</p>
<p>Without the proper technology, in 2020 companies are not equipped to handle deliveries effectively, to adapt to this crazy time, or to survive this competitive delivery landscape.</p>
<p>That’s why, according to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/supply-chain/insights/retail-supply-chain-management"><strong>Gartner</strong></a>, the biggest priorities in development included some kind of supply chain optimization and tech investment among retailers:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/supply-chain-retail-management.jpg" alt="last-mile-delivery-statistics" title="Top five investments in 2018 and 2019"></p>
<h2 id="2-high-cost-of-last-mile-delivery">#2 High cost of last-mile delivery</h2>
<p>The high-cost problem is not something that companies haven&rsquo;t faced before.</p>
<p>But with new and higher customer standards, the pressure on your budget is even higher today.</p>
<p>Even though many customers are ready to pay for expedited deliveries, for most companies it&rsquo;s challenging to accomplish it without losing money.</p>
<p><strong>The expectation of same-day deliveries has a big impact on the budget.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://shipware.com/blog/what-is-last-mile-logistics/#:~:text=Understanding%20the%20Costs%20of%20Last,of%20a%20shipment's%20total%20costs."><strong>28% of the entire delivery cost</strong></a> actually comes from the last-mile.</p>
<p>Typically, this is passed onto the user. But when that&rsquo;s not the case, it harms the company.</p>
<p>When it comes to online retail, irregular demands like an increased number of purchases during the holiday season is something that also has a huge impact.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This kind of challenge can be resolved with <strong>higher efficiency</strong> and <strong>better planning</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="3-transparency">#3 Transparency</h2>
<p>Humans want to understand everything and know everything, it’s in our blood.</p>
<p>As a result, transparency has become one of the key elements of any business.</p>
<p>Many businesses particularly 3PL providers started to generate <strong>tracking codes</strong>.</p>
<p>This allowed operators as well as users to gain certain visibility over their delivery.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/route-optimization-software.png" alt="route-optimization-software" title="Route optimization software"></p>
<p>Apart from being very curious, people don&rsquo;t get easily pleased. That&rsquo;s why tracking codes are not enough anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Nowadays, users want absolute real-time visibility.</strong> What does that exactly mean?</p>
<p>Basically, they want to see every step of the last-mile.</p>
<p>They want to see where the driver is and how long it will take him to arrive at their door.</p>
<p>Even if the delivery is on the same day, they still want to know the exact time of the arrival.</p>
<p><strong>With delivery management software, consumers can receive real-time updates about the movement of their shipment, including ETAs.</strong></p>
<p>Customers can track the shipment until it reaches their door.</p>
<p>Uber may have started this trend, but now people expect this kind of service and visibility for everything.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s one of the top forecasted <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-management-trends/" title="delivery management trends"><strong>delivery management trends</strong></a>, as well.</p>
<h2 id="4-the-efficiency-problem">#4 The efficiency problem</h2>
<p>Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency! This is what customers want. This is what companies want, as well.</p>
<p>The new business model is focused on the fast delivery of both products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Increased efficiency aids last-mile delivery logistics.</strong></p>
<p>And technology plays a key role when it comes to same-day and last-mile delivery.</p>
<p>To keep up with consumers' desires, delivery logistics management uses <strong>last-mile delivery software</strong>.</p>
<p>With its help, you can streamline deliveries all the way from the warehouse to the buyer&rsquo;s front door.</p>
<p>With last-mile delivery software, companies can simply re-route their workforce if they receive some last moment changes.</p>
<p>This is perfect because it can help with all the delays that are caused by last moment changes.</p>
<p>This can play a crucial role in making last-mile delivery more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Last-mile delivery software works through route optimization, dispatching, delivery analytics, proof of delivery, and customer alerts.</strong></p>
<p>With all of this, businesses can stay in non-stop communication with customers and speed up delivery.</p>
<p>This is crucial especially when it comes to poor address location.</p>
<h3 id="address-location--delivery-allocation">Address Location &amp; Delivery Allocation</h3>
<p>Actually, most failed deliveries are caused by incorrect addresses.</p>
<p>To understand the severity of the problem, you should know that <a href="https://postandparcel.info/93399/news/e-commerce/true-cost-implications-failed-deliveries/"><strong>the cost of a failed delivery can be as much as $16.58</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s not unusual that in most cases, the wrong address is a serious problem.</p>
<p>A lot of brands <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/are-you-still-planning-manually/" title="are you still manually planning delivery?"><strong>still manually plan deliveries</strong></a>, which naturally leaves room for human error.</p>
<h2 id="5-route-optimization">#5 Route Optimization</h2>
<p>Unless you are a professional, route planning is often utterly confusing and mentally taxing.</p>
<p>Maybe the worst part is that it depends on a variety of factors (from fuel efficiency to environmental regulations).</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p><strong>Route optimization is one of the key elements in last-mile deliveries.</strong></p>
<p>Route optimization has a big impact not only on cost but has a direct influence on ETAs (estimated time of arrival).</p>
<p>You have probably experienced a routing delay sometimes, so you know how bad that is.</p>
<p>Road works change street directions. Stoplights and other signals prevent the continuous flow of traffic.</p>
<p>At the same time, traffic congestion during peak hours is a constant problem.</p>
<p>The frequency of traffic also increases the chances of accidents. And other unexpected situations on the road.</p>
<p>Then, there are also rural customers. So, sometimes your delivery agent has to go beyond the boundaries of the city to fulfil an order.</p>
<p>All of this makes route optimization a complicated matter. But surely a necessary one.</p>
<p>There are a couple of ways to improve routing efficiency. And the best way is to use <strong>route optimization software</strong>.</p>
<p>But you need to take a look at <strong>last-mile delivery density</strong>, as well.</p>
<h3 id="last-mile-delivery-density">Last-Mile Delivery Density</h3>
<p>Imagine how hard it is to deliver packages in a dense urban area like London or New York.</p>
<p>Order volumes are higher, so delivering them is a massive undertaking.</p>
<p>Add to that same-day delivery, and you can imagine how challenging this is for any company.</p>
<p>On the one side, there are your capabilities. And on the other, there is your capacity.</p>
<p>To balance them, you need to look for the best last-mile delivery scenario. And that requires technology.</p>
<p>Typically, delivery management has <strong>4 different use-cases</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-density long distances</li>
<li>High-density short distances</li>
<li>Low-density long distances</li>
<li>Low-density short distances</li>
</ul>
<p>Managing each scenario is a problem on its own. But last-mile delivery software helps you with that.</p>
<p>Not only does it streamline your operations, but the tool also raises your number of capabilities.</p>
<p>At the same time, it optimizes how you use your resources. So, you can <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-improve-last-mile-delivery-when-demand-exceeds-your-capacity/" title="how to improve last-mile delivery when demand exceeds your capacity"><strong>improve last-mile delivery even when demand exceeds your capacity</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="6-customer-nuances-and-unpredictability-of-transit">#6 Customer Nuances and Unpredictability of Transit</h2>
<p>Whenever drivers are in transit, there is always a chance of something unpredictable happening to them.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is something that you can&rsquo;t control.</p>
<p>But poor transportation is also the result of poor infrastructure. (Particularly in developing countries)</p>
<p>This raises the unpredictability of last-mile distribution, which means inefficient routes, long journeys, and sub-sufficient transportation.</p>
<p>Translate all of this into costs and time lags, and you will see how bad the situation can be.</p>
<p>The only thing that you can do is <strong>streamline communication</strong> and <strong>create a contingency plan</strong>.</p>
<p>If a delay does happen, you and your teams will know how to react.</p>
<p>On the one hand, drivers can notify dispatch and operators as soon as it happens.</p>
<p>On the other, operators already have a plan of action. They can quickly dispatch replacement drivers to ensure 100% order fulfilment.</p>
<p>Another reason why communication is so important, and why you should use technology such as last-mile delivery software, is to ensure <strong>customer availability</strong>.</p>
<p>The last thing every delivery agent wants to experience after reaching his destination is that the customer isn’t home or is otherwise unavailable.</p>
<p>While a missed delivery can lead to a less-than-comfortable experience for the customer.</p>
<p>This may sound a bit unfair, but customers are pretty demanding and they often feel entitled.</p>
<p>To avoid all of this from happening, companies need to ensure good communication and seamless collaboration: <strong>internally</strong> (between teams) and <strong>externally</strong> (between you and your customers).</p>
<p>Regardless of the fact whether you use an <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/internal-vs-external-delivery-fleet-everything-you-need-to-know/" title="internal vs external delivery fleet"><strong>internal vs external delivery fleet</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="7-adherence-to-timelines">#7 Adherence to timelines</h2>
<p>This is one of the biggest battles that companies face.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, a missed deadline (time to deliver) is very expensive for companies in every single way.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/food-delivery-management-software-for-restaurants/"><strong>food delivery management at restaurants</strong></a> as an example.</p>
<p>Most companies can&rsquo;t charge the delivery to customers if they miss the time of arrival.</p>
<p>That’s because customers aren’t prepared to wait long times for meal delivery to arrive.</p>
<p>In fact, only one in four customers will accept delivery after waiting an hour or more for it:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/1.jpg" alt="last-mile-delivery-wait-times" title="Last mile delivery wait times"></p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all. That can ruin the reputation of your brand, as well.</p>
<p>So you have to know <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-plan-better-delivery-schedules/" title="how to plan better delivery schedules"><strong>how to plan better delivery schedules</strong></a> and give drivers enough time to complete all the deliveries on their route.</p>
<p>In this way, you can fulfil orders the way customers want.</p>
<p>But that’s not all.</p>
<h2 id="8-friction">#8 Friction</h2>
<p>A <strong>frictionless delivery</strong> streamlines performance and cut costs of your last-mile.</p>
<p><strong>One of the biggest causes of friction is dealing with customer inquiries and requests about how and when the package should be delivered.</strong></p>
<p>So, frictionless delivery can&rsquo;t be created without technology since it allows communication between the delivery agents and the customers.</p>
<p>If you use last-mile delivery software, you can reduce the chance of customers calling and wasting their time and the time of your customer service.</p>
<p>The same goes for any other member of your team.</p>
<p><strong>Instead, you can use delivery management software to set up automatic notifications.</strong></p>
<p>That reduces the need for direct communication between customers and your employees, while you still provide information to customers about their deliveries.</p>
<p>And the more information customers receive the less frustrated they are, and the less chance they will frustrate your employees.</p>
<p>Which means less friction across the board.</p>
<h2 id="9-covid-19">#9 Covid 19</h2>
<p>Ok, this is a pretty new challenge. But it’s one you have to address because it has disrupted many things. Including delivery.</p>
<p>When it comes to the last-mile delivery logistics, Covid 19 has had a rather dramatic effect on it this year.</p>
<p><strong>First, more and more people are shopping online because they can&rsquo;t leave their homes.</strong></p>
<p>On the one hand, that means more business, which is great.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it’s a problem to handle the flood of high delivery volumes.</p>
<p>That’s putting a lot of pressure on deliveries to meet the increase in demands, as they rely on capacities built before the pandemic.</p>
<p><a href="https://elogii.com/blog/the-state-of-delivery-in-time-of-the-coronavirus/" title="the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus"><strong>The state of delivery in time of the coronavirus</strong></a> has also changed customer expectations.</p>
<p>We’ve mentioned how customers have become more tolerant since the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean customers will give up a fast delivery.</p>
<p>Which means despite the increase in order volumes, companies still have to provide fast options like next-day and same-day delivery.</p>
<p>At the same time, many people have lost their jobs since the first lockdown.</p>
<p>So, more people than ever want free delivery. If you don’t offer a free option for online delivery, you may miss out on a potentially large target group.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>But these problems don’t stem only from changing customer expectations.</p>
<p><strong>The problems associated with COVID-19 also have to do with the raised safety concerns, and how they affect the delivery process.</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, the health and safety of your employees (and their families) has to be your top priority.</p>
<p>But at the same time the prescribed measures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slowing down delivery operations</li>
<li>Short-staffing teams and reducing capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it’s necessary to re-think last-mile delivery and adapt it to the New Normal.</p>
<p>For example, many companies have introduced curbside pick-up since the start of the pandemic to minimize contact between people.</p>
<p>Others have used doorstep delivery (leaving orders on customers’ doorstep), or lockers.</p>
<p>But speed suffers here, as well.</p>
<p><strong>So, the disruption of COVID-19 has prompted many more delivery owners to introduce technology and optimize delivery operations.</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, companies are relying more and more on delivery management software to handle their last-mile delivery operations.</p>
<p>Which has allowed them to tackle all the problems at once, and head-on.</p>
<p>Including your biggest concerns, like urgency, limited capacities, and inadequate capabilities.</p>
<p>And that leads you to a solution that optimizes the entire last-mile of delivery.</p>
