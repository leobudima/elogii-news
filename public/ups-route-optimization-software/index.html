          <p>In this post, we take a look at UPS and the success behind their route optimization software.</p>
<p>You’ll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is UPS Orion;</li>
<li>How does it work;</li>
<li>How effective it is;</li>
<li>Its benefits;</li>
<li>And what are the results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, you’ll get a chance to see how you can leverage route planning and optimization to improve your delivery, like UPS.</p>
<p>But more on that later.</p>
<p>Right now, the focus is all on UPS.</p>
<p>So, let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="a-culture-of-constructive-dissatisfaction">A culture of constructive dissatisfaction</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ups.com/us/en/Home.page"><strong>United Parcel Service (UPS)</strong></a> is a global powerhouse in last-mile delivery and logistics.</p>
<p>With more than a century of experience, the company today strives to evolve its <a href="https://www.ups.com/us/es/services/knowledge-center/article.page?name=why-saying-that-s-how-we-ve-always-done-it-can-stifle-growth&amp;kid=bf85088e"><strong><em>culture of constructive dissatisfaction</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p>And behind that culture is <strong>UPS' route optimization software</strong>.</p>
<p>Built on advanced route optimization algorithms, it&rsquo;s saving UPS large amounts of money while making the job easier for its workers.</p>
<p>With many benefits to the environment, as well.</p>
<p>After more than a decade in development, the company has perfected a solution for what it believes is the biggest problem in modern delivery - <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/difference-between-route-planning-and-route-optimization/"><strong>route optimization and route planning</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-routing-software-does-ups-use">What routing software does UPS use?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=PressReleases&amp;id=1543925402585-887"><strong>According to Juan Perez</strong></a> (UPS Chief Information and Engineering Officer):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>UPS drivers make an average of 125 stops each day.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a far cry from on-foot and bicycle delivery of packages 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Second, UPS drivers make deliveries to a lot of places, as well.</p>
<p>Sometimes, these locations aren&rsquo;t easily accessible or visible from the main roads, which makes it hard to reach these places using traditional mapping software.</p>
<p>Now, consider that UPS is a multinational company.</p>
<p>It handles entire shipments, deliveries, and distribution networks outside of the United States.</p>
<p>In more than <strong>220 countries</strong> and territories in which it operates.</p>
<p>With more than <a href="https://pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=FactSheets&amp;id=1426321563187-193"><strong>20 million global packages</strong></a> delivered daily.</p>
<p>And the company employs more than <strong>100,000 drivers</strong>, as well.</p>
<p>That would be impossible to do with manual planning or legacy tools.</p>
<p>So, to optimize multi-stop route planning for all these tasks, UPS had to develop its route planning software.</p>
<p>Their solution is <strong>ORION - <em>On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation</em></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ups-orion">What is UPS Orion?</h2>
<p>More than a decade in the making, <strong>Orion is a route planning app that uses a complex algorithm to optimize multi-drop route planning</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16iibYagCCI"><strong>video about UPS Orion</strong></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But before all of this had happened, there were years of continued investment and research.</p>
<p>The first significant implementation of the software came in 2013.</p>
<p>At the time, the company applied it to only <strong>10,000 UPS routes</strong>.</p>
<p>But Orion&rsquo;s performance turned out to be better than expected.</p>
<p>So, UPS had to speed up the scale of its US deployment, and the full launch came in 2016.</p>
<p>The company regularly rolls out new updates and improvements, but the system hasn’t changed much since then.</p>
<p>All this came at a price.</p>
<p>UPS invested an estimated <a href="https://www.pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=Factsheets&amp;id=1426321616277-282&amp;WT.mc_id=PRESSRELEASE_BB4_ORION_ORIONBACKGROUNDER_012920"><strong>$1 billion per year</strong></a> into the project, making Orion one of the World&rsquo;s largest projects of this kind.</p>
<p>One of the key moves by UPS in developing the app was <strong>installing GPS devices and vehicle sensors in its vehicles in 2008</strong>.</p>
<p>By tracking GPS locations, UPS gathered large amounts of data like <strong>vehicle routes</strong> and <strong>vehicles idle times</strong>.</p>
<p>In the end, all this data resulted in more than <strong>1000 pages of code</strong> in the algorithm used by Orion.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Orion uses countless amounts of data to help UPS drivers find the optimal way to deliver and pick-up packages.</p>
<p>Orion calculates routes based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of stops;</li>
<li>Start time;</li>
<li>Commit time;</li>
<li>Pick up windows, and;</li>
<li>Special customer requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only does it calculate the shortest distance between two locations, it also takes into account factors like <strong>fuel consumption</strong> and <strong>traffic</strong>.</p>
<p>It also uses an online map specifically customized by UPS to help its professionals in planning routes.</p>
<p>During delivery, Orion can solve any alteration within the planned route in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>Orion is an online route optimization software.</p>
<p>And while it is accessed via any device across UPS’ thousands of hubs, the physical servers are located in Mahwah, New Jersey.</p>
<p>All the data that drivers collect arrives here. It is then processed, and added to the system to improve the software, thanks to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-trends-on-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence-2019/"><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Another part of UPS’ route optimization software is the drivers’ <strong>Delivery Information Acquisition Device (DIAD)</strong>.</p>
<p>DIAD is a handheld tool that drivers usually mount on the dashboard of their vehicles that allows hands-free use of Orion.</p>
<p>It was first introduced in 1991, and UPS is currently using the fifth generation of DIAD (with the sixth one in development).</p>
<p>The company also relies on <strong>UPSNav</strong> - the latest Orion update.</p>
<p>UPSNav optimizes route delivery for drivers by providing precise details about locations, even when it comes to the point of entry at the pick-up and drop-off sites.</p>
<h2 id="solving-the-traveling-salesman-problem">Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem</h2>
<p>What is the shortest possible route between multiple points which you can reach before returning to the starting point?</p>
<p>This question is the basis of the <strong>Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)</strong>.</p>
<p>First formulated in the early 20th century, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem"><strong>Travelling Salesman Problem</strong></a> is crucial not only in logistics but in numerous other fields such as computer sciences, operations research and, to some degree, even in DNA sequencing.</p>
<p>When applying it to two stops, the problem is pretty straight-forward.</p>
<p>But with more than 100 stops per day that UPS drivers make, the possibilities are endless. And the problem, a Gordian knot.</p>
<p>For example, with 10 locations there can be around 300,000 combinations. Increase the number of destinations to 15, and you get more than 87 billion permutations.</p>
<p>Because of this, it isn&rsquo;t hard to realize that optimizing routes for any large number of stops is close to humanly impossible.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s where advanced algorithms, coding, and AI come into play to form route optimization apps.</p>
<p>Just as dividing two three-digit numbers takes our brains at least a couple of seconds, it&rsquo;s almost instantaneous for a basic calculator.</p>
<p>A similar thing happens with route planning optimization.</p>
<p>But as we mentioned earlier, a critical part of the whole problem-solving is the input of the correct data.</p>
<p><strong>Orion can give UPS drivers an optimal route in a matter of seconds thanks to years of quality data input into an algorithm that Orion and UPSNav use.</strong></p>
<p>Orion lets you update or correct its online maps in real-time if delivery or pick-up points change during live operations.</p>
<p>That is essential for perfecting how route planners work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, AI steps in to utilize all of this data to find the best possible path for a driver to make his drop-offs/pick-ups.</p>
<p>Of course, before Orion, and before AI, drivers or other workers planned routes by themselves.</p>
<p>But solving the TSP with the amount of deliveries UPS does daily in an efficient manner is virtually an impossible task for drivers.</p>
<p>Not only that, it would be time-consuming as well.</p>
<p>By using Orion, UPS enables their drivers to focus on driving and delivery, without the additional distraction of planning delivery routes.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-route-optimization-software">The benefits of route optimization software</h2>
<p>Modern vehicles have AI systems that use complicated algorithms to improve driver safety beyond human capabilities.</p>
<p>Our phones have apps that help us with tedious, everyday tasks, and make them easy to do.</p>
<p>So, it stands to reason that we should use software and apps to make delivery route optimization easier, as well.</p>
<p>That’s why UPS had invested billions of dollars to develop Orion.</p>
<p>Seeing the results, it’s safe to say that it was money well spent.</p>
<p><strong>But route optimization software is now available to all companies, regardless of their shape, size, or industry.</strong></p>
<p>Now, every business can profit and improve its delivery just like UPS.</p>
<p>And to know what results you can expect, here are the main benefits of route optimization apps and how you can get a quick return like UPS:</p>
<h3 id="shorter-delivery-times">Shorter delivery times</h3>
<p>The Oxford Dictionary describes optimization as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The action of making the best or most effective use of a situation or resource.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it’s quite obvious that one of the main benefits of using a route optimization app is a better use of your resources.</p>
<p>By using Orion, <strong>UPS is first and foremost saving time</strong>. And we all know that saving time is saving money.</p>
<p>Their drivers have clearly defined and exact routes from point A to point B, as well as detailed turn-by-turn instructions on how to get there.</p>
<p>That ensures all they have to do is focus on driving to the next drop-off or pick-up point.</p>
<p>By organizing multiple destinations into the best possible route, <strong>Orion makes life easier for everyone involved – drivers, operators, route planners, but customers as well.</strong></p>
<p>Consider how the speed of delivery means customers wait less for their order to arrive.</p>
<p>With faster delivery, customers are bound to spend more and order more products.</p>
<p>That raises the income of any business that leverages the power of route optimization software.</p>
<h3 id="fuel-consumption">Fuel consumption</h3>
<p><strong>Better route optimization means shorter distances vehicles have to travel, which means less fuel consumption.</strong></p>
<p>UPS says Orion is saving them about <a href="https://www.pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=Factsheets&amp;id=1426321616277-282#:~:text=ORION%20saves%20UPS%20about%20100,by%20about%20100%2C000%20metric%20tons."><strong>100 million miles per year</strong></a>. That&rsquo;s around <strong>10 million gallons of fuel</strong>.</p>
<p>The average price for a gallon of fuel in the US is around $2.5.</p>
<p>So, the math here is pretty clear.</p>
<p>Likewise, UPS has a <strong><em>Don’t turn left policy</em></strong>, which was introduced back in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The idea is that the vehicles should avoid going against the flow of traffic and avoid making left turns.</p>
<p>When turning left, the vehicle has to wait for cross-traffic to pass, which wastes both time and fuel.</p>
<p>Orion route optimization takes this into account, as well.</p>
<p>It creates paths with more right turns, which makes each route even more fuel-efficient and cost-effective.</p>
<p><strong>UPS estimates it saves them additional 10 million gallons a year.</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, reducing fuel consumption also means fewer carbon emissions.</p>
<p>UPS estimates that&rsquo;s around <a href="https://www.upperinc.com/ups-route-planning-software/"><strong>100,000 metric tons</strong></a> of CO2 a year, so it&rsquo;s an added benefit for the environment.</p>
<h3 id="better-fleet-utilization">Better fleet utilization</h3>
<p>Whether your company has a couple of vans or 125,000 as UPS, it’s in your best interest to make your vehicles remain operational as long as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Fleet route optimization means fewer miles travelled.</strong></p>
<p>That translates to extended use of each vehicle, and less wear and tear. And that makes each vehicle in your fleet more reliable.</p>
<p>But every vehicle needs regular service and maintenance, as well. And that’s another cost you have to take into account.</p>
<p>However, decreasing the miles travelled also minimizes the chance of malfunction, and reduces the need for constant repairs.</p>
<p>Be it a flat tire or something more serious, like a breakdown.</p>
<p>All in all, <strong>UPS estimates that Orion saves them $400 million per year on vehicle maintenance alone.</strong></p>
<h3 id="making-the-job-easier-for-drivers">Making the job easier for drivers</h3>
<p><strong>Because of route planning software, UPS drivers focus more on driving and deliveries.</strong></p>
<p>As we mentioned before, they make <strong>more than 100 stops per day</strong>. That’s a lot of responsibility as is.</p>
<p>Having to worry about traffic or which way to go at the next intersection would make their day a lot more complicated.</p>
<p><strong>Less experienced drivers benefit the most, here.</strong></p>
<p>Whenever drivers start a new delivery route, having an app that tells them where and when to turn to reach a customer’s address makes their job a whole lot easier.</p>
<h3 id="customer-satisfaction">Customer satisfaction</h3>
<p>Any business move you take has to serve and satisfy your customers.</p>
<p><strong>Route optimization software makes deliveries and pick-ups more organized. But it also makes your customers happier.</strong></p>
<p>A route planning app that can navigate a driver through alternative roads to a drop-off site but also provide customers with precise ETA updates in real-time, is a win-win situation.</p>
<p>That makes it easier for customers to plan their day around other responsibilities, rather than the delivery itself.</p>
<p>In return, it reduces the need for extra communication between your customer support teams and customers.</p>
<p>And that lowers the frustration of everyone involved.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-best-route-planning-software">What is the best route planning software?</h2>
<p>It’s safe to assume that any route planning software has to have multi-stop route planning capabilities.</p>
<p>But it has to have it well-developed and advanced, as well.</p>
<p>For example, Google Maps has a multi-stop route planning feature.</p>
<p>But it’s pretty basic when compared to Orion. And the number of stops is limited.</p>
<p>Control over fuel consumption is paramount, as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most consistent costs of running a delivery, as well as an essential one.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t afford to leave out the exact and precise numbers when calculating <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/7-key-metrics-in-delivery-logistics-to-measure-for-success/"><strong>key metrics in delivery logistics</strong></a>, such as fuel consumption.</p>
<p>Having a fleet of vehicles adds another factor.</p>
<p>Be it an <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/internal-vs-external-delivery-fleet-everything-you-need-to-know/"><strong>internal vs external fleet</strong></a>, you have to have an app that can organize drivers without overlaps in their schedules or delivery areas.</p>
<p>And all of this needs to happen in an optimal amount of time.</p>
<p>If you have an app that calculates routes in tens of minutes, rather than seconds, you can find yourself in trouble when you have to make swift decisions.</p>
<p>If one of your vehicles breaks down, for example, you have to reassign other drivers to that route or drop-off to make up for the loss.</p>
<p>So having an app that can do this quickly is also essential for <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/agile-delivery-operations/"><strong>building an agile delivery operation</strong></a>.</p>
<p>But not all companies are UPS.</p>
<p>Nor do they have the resources of UPS.</p>
<p>Nor are they global leaders in the delivery logistics.</p>
<p>Fortunately for you, there are other apps out there that can get the job done extremely well and at a much lower cost.</p>
