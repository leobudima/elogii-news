The modern consumer wants everything now.\nIn fact, fast and free shipping is the main reason 79.8% of people shop on Amazon.\nFor most retailers, this is probably one of your biggest challenges. Especially, when you want to know how to compete with Amazon delivery.\nThings are looking up, though.\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, people have become more patient.\nIn fact, consumers are more tolerant of delivery delays but also show less brand loyalty in 2020.\nIt stands to reason that if you can minimize delays, you might win over customers this year.\nSo, companies need to re-design and re-think their last-mile delivery strategy and incorporate different delivery tactics to grow operations.\nThey need to make sure that online services are both profitable and agile in order to be appreciated by consumers.\n Read our guide if you want to know how to build an agile delivery operation.\n The change in consumers' behaviour leads us to the problem of outdated technology.\nOutdated Technology Even though we are living in the modern digital world, almost half of all distribution, delivery, and transportation companies admit their technology is outdated.\nSo, what\u0026rsquo;s the impact of outdated technology on their organizations?\nActually, outdated technology can cause you to lose customers.\nWithout the proper technology, in 2020 companies are not equipped to handle deliveries effectively, to adapt to this crazy time, or to survive this competitive delivery landscape.\nThat’s why, according to Gartner, the biggest priorities in development included some kind of supply chain optimization and tech investment among retailers:\n#2 High cost of last-mile delivery The high-cost problem is not something that companies haven\u0026rsquo;t faced before.\nBut with new and higher customer standards, the pressure on your budget is even higher today.\nEven though many customers are ready to pay for expedited deliveries, for most companies it\u0026rsquo;s challenging to accomplish it without losing money.\nThe expectation of same-day deliveries has a big impact on the budget.\nIn fact, 28% of the entire delivery cost actually comes from the last-mile.\nTypically, this is passed onto the user. But when that\u0026rsquo;s not the case, it harms the company.\nWhen it comes to online retail, irregular demands like an increased number of purchases during the holiday season is something that also has a huge impact.\n Take a look at our deep dive into the last-mile delivery logistics behind Black Friday to find out more.\n This kind of challenge can be resolved with higher efficiency and better planning.\n#3 Transparency Humans want to understand everything and know everything, it’s in our blood.\nAs a result, transparency has become one of the key elements of any business.\nMany businesses particularly 3PL providers started to generate tracking codes.\nThis allowed operators as well as users to gain certain visibility over their delivery.\nApart from being very curious, people don\u0026rsquo;t get easily pleased. That\u0026rsquo;s why tracking codes are not enough anymore.\nNowadays, users want absolute real-time visibility. What does that exactly mean?\nBasically, they want to see every step of the last-mile.\nThey want to see where the driver is and how long it will take him to arrive at their door.\nEven if the delivery is on the same day, they still want to know the exact time of the arrival.\nWith delivery management software, consumers can receive real-time updates about the movement of their shipment, including ETAs.\nCustomers can track the shipment until it reaches their door.\nUber may have started this trend, but now people expect this kind of service and visibility for everything.\nThat’s why it’s one of the top forecasted delivery management trends, as well.\n#4 The efficiency problem Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency! This is what customers want. This is what companies want, as well.\nThe new business model is focused on the fast delivery of both products and services.\nIncreased efficiency aids last-mile delivery logistics.\nAnd technology plays a key role when it comes to same-day and last-mile delivery.\nTo keep up with consumers' desires, delivery logistics management uses last-mile delivery software.\nWith its help, you can streamline deliveries all the way from the warehouse to the buyer\u0026rsquo;s front door.\nWith last-mile delivery software, companies can simply re-route their workforce if they receive some last moment changes.\nThis is perfect because it can help with all the delays that are caused by last moment changes.\nThis can play a crucial role in making last-mile delivery more efficient.\nLast-mile delivery software works through route optimization, dispatching, delivery analytics, proof of delivery, and customer alerts.\nWith all of this, businesses can stay in non-stop communication with customers and speed up delivery.\nThis is crucial especially when it comes to poor address location.\nAddress Location \u0026amp; Delivery Allocation Actually, most failed deliveries are caused by incorrect addresses.\nTo understand the severity of the problem, you should know that the cost of a failed delivery can be as much as $16.58.\nTherefore, it\u0026rsquo;s not unusual that in most cases, the wrong address is a serious problem.\nA lot of brands still manually plan deliveries, which naturally leaves room for human error.\n#5 Route Optimization Unless you are a professional, route planning is often utterly confusing and mentally taxing.\nMaybe the worst part is that it depends on a variety of factors (from fuel efficiency to environmental regulations).\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s important.\nRoute optimization is one of the key elements in last-mile deliveries.\nRoute optimization has a big impact not only on cost but has a direct influence on ETAs (estimated time of arrival).\nYou have probably experienced a routing delay sometimes, so you know how bad that is.\nRoad works change street directions. Stoplights and other signals prevent the continuous flow of traffic.\nAt the same time, traffic congestion during peak hours is a constant problem.\nThe frequency of traffic also increases the chances of accidents. And other unexpected situations on the road.\nThen, there are also rural customers. So, sometimes your delivery agent has to go beyond the boundaries of the city to fulfil an order.\nAll of this makes route optimization a complicated matter. But surely a necessary one.\nThere are a couple of ways to improve routing efficiency. And the best way is to use route optimization software.\nBut you need to take a look at last-mile delivery density, as well.\nLast-Mile Delivery Density Imagine how hard it is to deliver packages in a dense urban area like London or New York.\nOrder volumes are higher, so delivering them is a massive undertaking.\nAdd to that same-day delivery, and you can imagine how challenging this is for any company.\nOn the one side, there are your capabilities. And on the other, there is your capacity.\nTo balance them, you need to look for the best last-mile delivery scenario. And that requires technology.\nTypically, delivery management has 4 different use-cases:\n High-density long distances High-density short distances Low-density long distances Low-density short distances  Managing each scenario is a problem on its own. But last-mile delivery software helps you with that.\nNot only does it streamline your operations, but the tool also raises your number of capabilities.\nAt the same time, it optimizes how you use your resources. So, you can improve last-mile delivery even when demand exceeds your capacity.\n#6 Customer Nuances and Unpredictability of Transit Whenever drivers are in transit, there is always a chance of something unpredictable happening to them.\nSadly, this is something that you can\u0026rsquo;t control.\nBut poor transportation is also the result of poor infrastructure. (Particularly in developing countries)\nThis raises the unpredictability of last-mile distribution, which means inefficient routes, long journeys, and sub-sufficient transportation.\nTranslate all of this into costs and time lags, and you will see how bad the situation can be.\nThe only thing that you can do is streamline communication and create a contingency plan.\nIf a delay does happen, you and your teams will know how to react.\nOn the one hand, drivers can notify dispatch and operators as soon as it happens.\nOn the other, operators already have a plan of action. They can quickly dispatch replacement drivers to ensure 100% order fulfilment.\nAnother reason why communication is so important, and why you should use technology such as last-mile delivery software, is to ensure customer availability.\nThe last thing every delivery agent wants to experience after reaching his destination is that the customer isn’t home or is otherwise unavailable.\nWhile a missed delivery can lead to a less-than-comfortable experience for the customer.\nThis may sound a bit unfair, but customers are pretty demanding and they often feel entitled.\nTo avoid all of this from happening, companies need to ensure good communication and seamless collaboration: internally (between teams) and externally (between you and your customers).\nRegardless of the fact whether you use an internal vs external delivery fleet.\n#7 Adherence to timelines This is one of the biggest battles that companies face.\nAs we mentioned earlier, a missed deadline (time to deliver) is very expensive for companies in every single way.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take food delivery management at restaurants as an example.\nMost companies can\u0026rsquo;t charge the delivery to customers if they miss the time of arrival.\nThat’s because customers aren’t prepared to wait long times for meal delivery to arrive.\nIn fact, only one in four customers will accept delivery after waiting an hour or more for it:\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not all. That can ruin the reputation of your brand, as well.\nSo you have to know how to plan better delivery schedules and give drivers enough time to complete all the deliveries on their route.\nIn this way, you can fulfil orders the way customers want.\nBut that’s not all.\n#8 Friction A frictionless delivery streamlines performance and cut costs of your last-mile.\nOne of the biggest causes of friction is dealing with customer inquiries and requests about how and when the package should be delivered.\nSo, frictionless delivery can\u0026rsquo;t be created without technology since it allows communication between the delivery agents and the customers.\nIf you use last-mile delivery software, you can reduce the chance of customers calling and wasting their time and the time of your customer service.\nThe same goes for any other member of your team.\nInstead, you can use delivery management software to set up automatic notifications.\nThat reduces the need for direct communication between customers and your employees, while you still provide information to customers about their deliveries.\nAnd the more information customers receive the less frustrated they are, and the less chance they will frustrate your employees.\nWhich means less friction across the board.\n#9 Covid 19 Ok, this is a pretty new challenge. But it’s one you have to address because it has disrupted many things. Including delivery.\nWhen it comes to the last-mile delivery logistics, Covid 19 has had a rather dramatic effect on it this year.\nFirst, more and more people are shopping online because they can\u0026rsquo;t leave their homes.\nOn the one hand, that means more business, which is great.\nBut on the other hand, it’s a problem to handle the flood of high delivery volumes.\nThat’s putting a lot of pressure on deliveries to meet the increase in demands, as they rely on capacities built before the pandemic.\nThe state of delivery in time of the coronavirus has also changed customer expectations.\nWe’ve mentioned how customers have become more tolerant since the start of the pandemic.\nBut that doesn’t mean customers will give up a fast delivery.\nWhich means despite the increase in order volumes, companies still have to provide fast options like next-day and same-day delivery.\nAt the same time, many people have lost their jobs since the first lockdown.\nSo, more people than ever want free delivery. If you don’t offer a free option for online delivery, you may miss out on a potentially large target group.\n Read our guide if you want to find out how to offer free delivery to your customers.\n But these problems don’t stem only from changing customer expectations.\nThe problems associated with COVID-19 also have to do with the raised safety concerns, and how they affect the delivery process.\nSpecifically, the health and safety of your employees (and their families) has to be your top priority.\nBut at the same time the prescribed measures are:\n Slowing down delivery operations Short-staffing teams and reducing capacity  So, it’s necessary to re-think last-mile delivery and adapt it to the New Normal.\nFor example, many companies have introduced curbside pick-up since the start of the pandemic to minimize contact between people.\nOthers have used doorstep delivery (leaving orders on customers’ doorstep), or lockers.\nBut speed suffers here, as well.\nSo, the disruption of COVID-19 has prompted many more delivery owners to introduce technology and optimize delivery operations.\nSpecifically, companies are relying more and more on delivery management software to handle their last-mile delivery operations.\nWhich has allowed them to tackle all the problems at once, and head-on.\nIncluding your biggest concerns, like urgency, limited capacities, and inadequate capabilities.\nAnd that leads you to a solution that optimizes the entire last-mile of delivery.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

Grocery delivery software is a logistical tool designed to help you automatically manage delivery activities, such as scheduling pick-ups and drop-offs, planning routes, dispatching drivers, and tracking progress across operations.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s called grocery delivery software because it lets you handle all tasks from when you receive an order to when you deliver it to the customer.\nThat includes:\n Creating tasks and schedules; Planning and optimizing routes; Assigning orders to drivers; Dispatching drivers; Tracking progress; Notifying customers; Collecting feedback; And more.  How does grocery delivery software work? Grocery delivery software is a complex system.\nIt has multiple modules for handling different desired actions.\nFor example, one module is responsible for planning routes, while another for tracking your driver on those routes.\nEach module relies on its own set of codes and algorithms to perform these operations.\nAnd all of them integrate to a centralized system - the grocery delivery platform.\n Read this post to know whether to centralize or not to centralize delivery operations.\n You see (and use) the platform via its two main components:\n The dashboard The driver app  The dashboard is the central control panel. From there, you have full use of all of the modules and a real-time view of the operation.\nFor example, you can assign tasks to drivers. Or dispatch drivers to a customer location. Or see where your drivers are on the map.\nThe driver app is a mobile version (Android or iOS) of the software. It gives access to vital data and functions to drivers which they need to perform tasks in the field.\nFor example, a driver can see where his future drop-offs are going to be. Or view the name of his next customer. Or collect the electronic proof of delivery.\nSo with grocery delivery software, there’s ONE tool for managing the entire delivery.\nAnd that’s what makes it unique.\nHow is grocery delivery software different from other solutions? Grocery delivery software is an end-to-end solution.\nIt can connect to other vital tools that you use:\n Online grocery store; Order management system; Inventory managing software; And others.  That is possible, thanks to API integration. (But more on that later)\nSo like we’ve just mentioned, all you need is one tool to manage the entire supply chain.\nWhy does grocery delivery software work so well for business? Unlike legacy systems, grocery delivery software works on the cloud.\nBesides the many benefits of this, adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics enables you to:\n Gain real-time visibility; Build an agile delivery; Take a holistic approach to logistics, and; Scale as you grow.  Here\u0026rsquo;s our pick of the top delivery tactics to grow your operations.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easier to stay on top of what\u0026rsquo;s going on, regardless of size, scale, and order volumes.\n Who can use grocery delivery software?\nIn the second part of the article, we’ll turn our attention to you - the user.\nHere, you’ll find out whether grocery delivery software is the right tool for your business.\nSpecifically, you’ll see whether the system can match your needs. And the nature of your grocery delivery.\nLet’s jump right in.\nFor online grocery shopping Online grocery shopping isn’t a new invention.\nBut COVID-19 and social distancing have prompted more stores to rethink their approach and move their offer online.\nIf you own an online grocery store, then you rely a lot on delivery.\nBut you also know that it’s not your main sales offer. (Groceries are)\nSo, you need to keep delivery costs down. But also provide the best service to customers.\n(More on the benefits of grocery delivery software later)\nFor a standalone (single) grocery store If you have a single bricks and mortar grocery store, you might overlook the benefits of the software.\nBut the fact of the matter is that technology can help you.\nYou know that a lot of your regulars are buying more and more groceries from places like Amazon’s Whole Foods, Tesco, ASDA, Walmart, Sainsbury’s, and other chains.\nAnd you know the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus has reshaped the landscape.\nIn 2020, many customers have shopped online using Uber, Doordash, Postmates, Grubhub, and Glovo grocery delivery.\nAnd it may seem like dire straits there is a solution:\nThe secret to know how to compete with Amazon delivery, Walmart, GrubHub and other giants, is to co-exist with them.\nBut that means you’ll need to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses and rethink the way you deliver groceries.\nBased on experience, we suggest that you focus on the local last-mile.\nCover the local delivery area (3-5 kilometres) near your store. But use delivery management software to increase the speed and efficiency of your operations.\nFor grocery chains Like mom-and-pop stores, it isn’t easy grocery chains, either.\nFor you, grocery delivery software isn’t a huge investment. But it still helps you raise the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of your delivery.\nSpecifically, the software is a one-stop solution.\nSo, all you need is one tool to manage delivery at each one of your stores.\nRegardless of whether it\u0026rsquo;s a regional or nationwide chain of stores, you have complete control and visibility from one central location.\nGrocery delivery software for different types of delivery Grocery delivery software isn’t limited just to the kind of store you have. You can also use it for different purposes.\nIncluding:\n Grocery home delivery Grocery curbside delivery Doorstep grocery delivery On-demand grocery delivery Grocery in-store pickup  That’s because grocery delivery software is an end-to-end solution.\nInstead of focusing on one area of operations, it enables you to take a holistic approach.\nYou can manage the entire life-cycle of each delivery. (From the moment you receive an order to when a driver drops it off to the customer)\nAt the same time, you can monitor every aspect of last-mile delivery. (From how you source supplies to how much inventory you have to where your drivers are in the field)\nWhich means you can communicate internally and externally, such as customers and suppliers, as well as different teams inside your organization.\nAnd that’s the main reason why grocery delivery software supports any offer you provide to customers.\n How to use grocery delivery software to improve last-mile delivery?\nNow, it’s time to show you exactly how to improve your grocery delivery.\nSpecifically, you’ll see the top three last-mile challenges and how software helps you to overcome them.\nYou’ll learn how to:\n Grow the rate of delivery Increase route density Upgrade operations Improve customer experience  Let’s get started.\nLast-mile delivery challenges for grocery delivery The last mile is a logistical problem because it requires you to manage customer expectations efficiently.\nWhich means you will have to make it super easy for customers to order and receive groceries.\nAnd this can be difficult to achieve when you don\u0026rsquo;t want to waste a lot of resources.\nWhich means you will have to optimize the last mile.\nWhen it comes to grocery delivery, we believe that these three challenges will be your leading concerns:\nCompleting multiple delivery stops Last-mile delivery isn’t about travelling from point A to point B, and back.\nFirst, that kind of delivery raises the number of miles drivers have to travel. Which means you increase the cost per delivery.\nSecond, you need a big fleet if drivers have to return to the store after each delivery. So, you can’t handle large order volumes.\nThat’s not very cost-effective.\nSo, drivers need to have more than one stop (drop-off) on their routes. (Even when delivering perishable groceries)\nBut each drop-off adds to the time it takes to complete each route.\nJust one stop involves:\n Travelling to the destination Waiting in traffic Finding the right address Walking to the door Interacting with the customer Walking back to the vehicle  And that can take 30 minutes or more depending on the delivery area your store covers.\nSo, there is still a lot of wasted resources in this process, as well.\nDelivering groceries in dense neighbourhoods It’s one thing to deliver 15 tons of groceries from a supplier to your warehouse using a truck on a motorway.\nIt’s quite another for a van to deliver that same amount to homes and offices in a dense urban area.\nDrivers have to deal with speed limits, narrow and one-way streets, traffic congestion, public transportation, and pedestrians. And to and from multiple stops, several times a day.\nAll of that lowers the speed of delivery.\nWhich means delivering groceries in cities and to rural areas takes a lot more time.\nHandling missed and failed deliveries Order accuracy is a common problem with direct-to-consumer delivery.\nBut accuracy can drop for many reasons, including:\n The customer gave you the wrong address; The customer isn’t at home; The driver failed to find the address; The order got misplaced during packaging; And others.  Some might be the fault of your workforce. Some are the fault of your customers. But all of them hurt your business.\nFor starters, failed and missed deliveries damage your reputation. You risk losing customers over a bad experience and negative reviews.\nAt the same time, you need to cover the cost of reverse logistics, returns, and refunds. And that affects your bottom line.\n Read this guide if you want to know how to handle reverse logistics and e-commerce returns.\n How to solve last-mile grocery delivery challenges? Those are the most common challenges of the last-mile. Now, let’s see how grocery delivery software helps you solve them:\nRoute optimization Route optimization is one of the main features of grocery delivery software.\nBesides helping you find the best path from point A to point B, it also allows you to map multiple stops on multiple routes and for all of your drivers, automatically.\nThat takes away a lot of the pressure from route planners (especially if they are still manually planning routes).\nGrocery delivery software works on the cloud.\nAll of the maps that you view on the dashboard are accurate and up to date. So, there is less chance for drivers to miss their drop-offs.\nLikewise, using software to optimize routes lets you include a lot of parameters that reduce the time per delivery.\nYou can add:\n  Traffic patterns\n  Stops and traffic lights\n  Right-side turns\n  Access and exit points\n(to pick-up and drop-off)\n  And more.\n  All of this cuts the time it takes to complete multi-stop delivery in dense urban areas.\nDelivery schedules Grocery delivery software allows you to manage schedules based on order volumes and daily tasks and activities.\nYou can determine the actual time it takes a driver to complete a drop-off. But also, calculate the average time in transit more easily.\nThat enables you to create a schedule that maximizes drivers' productivity.\nFor example, you can set the time at each drop-off to 15 minutes. That leaves drivers enough time to find, walk up to, talk to the customer, and get back to their vehicles.\nAt the same time, the software automatically calculates ETAs.\nSo, you know the travel time from one location to the next. Which means you can track idle time.\nAfter you add lunch breaks, rests, refuelling/resupply stops, you know the exact number of deliveries each driver can handle during a shift.\nPlanning schedules like this raise the route density for each driver. Which means you lower the cost per delivery, as well.\nBut you also increase the speed of delivery. That grows the rate of fulfilment, so you can easily handle multi-stop routes in dense urban areas.\nPlus, you gain complete control over the whole schedule.\nWhich means you can add contingency time in case you come across missed or failed deliveries.\n Read our guide on how to plan better delivery schedules.\n Driver and fleet management If you have a chain of stores, different fleets likely cover different delivery areas.\nGrocery delivery software helps you with this, as well.\nYou can input information about each driver and vehicle in every fleet into the system.\nFor example, a unique skill, or specialized equipment, or various load capacities.\nThat allows you to rightsize each fleet based on the demand within its area of operation.\nSo, when demand exceeds your capacity, your last-mile won’t suffer.\nLive control \u0026amp; visibility On-demand grocery delivery has to rely on speed. (Especially since the outbreak of COVID-19)\nTraditionally, when a new order arrives, you would deliver it tomorrow. Or, the customer would have to order groceries ahead of time.\nThat’s not very convenient.\nThat’s why all of the mentioned features work in real-time, as well.\nAnd since you have a complete overview of what’s happening on the map, you control the whole delivery on the go.\nFor example, grocery delivery apps allow you to offer same-day delivery.\nWhen an order arrives, you can see which driver is closest to the nearest store, or warehouse, and add a new pick-up and drop-off to his route.\nThe driver gets notified about the new tasks via the driver app, while the customer receives the order faster than expected.\nReal-time capabilities are also useful when you have to handle failed or missed deliveries.\nIf a driver notifies you about a return, you can assign an available driver to pick-up and deliver the order straight away.\nAnd in the case of a missed delivery, you can have two drivers meet, exchange orders, and drop them off at a more convenient time for the customer.\nWhether it\u0026rsquo;s the fault of someone on your team or the customer, you won\u0026rsquo;t risk the reputation of your business.\nYou can handle reverse logistics fast. And without consequence to customer experience.\nBut this is just the tip of the iceberg.\nThere are a lot more ways grocery delivery software improves your service.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how:\nBenefits of grocery delivery software This part of the article is a list of some of the best benefits of grocery delivery software.\nWe’ll not only provide you with a bunch of advantages of the software but why each one can work for your grocery delivery. (Regardless of its size and shape)\nMore importantly, we’ll show you how you and your customers can get MORE value.\nLet’s check out these benefits.\nConvenient grocery delivery experience We’ve touched on convenience a bit. But did you know that it’s one of the top three reasons why your customers shop online?\nIn a study on The Future of Customer Experience by PwC, 80% of customers said that speed, convenience and knowledgeable service are what they value most.\nIn the same way that it’s more convenient for customers to order online, it should be just as easy to receive them.\nEnter: grocery delivery management software.\nFirst, the software lets you offer customers to choose when they want orders to arrive.\nYou can set up specific time windows customers can choose at checkout.\nYou can let them choose the date of delivery but also the time of day when they want it to arrive, like mornings or afternoons.\nThat means customers can organize themselves around work and other activities, rather than the ETA of their order.\nFor your business, that means greater accuracy. And you reduce the chance of missed deliveries.\nUsing a grocery delivery platform also allows you to send tracking links and notifications.\nCustomers can remain involved in the delivery process by tracking their order on the map.\nSo, they know exactly where their order is, and when the driver will drop it off.\nAnd for the very best doorstep grocery delivery experience, drivers can send quick reminders. Or you can set up automatic notifications.\nSo once a driver confirms that the delivery is complete, the app automatically sends a text message or email to the next customer that their order is on its way.\nComplete integration None of the above would be possible without complete integration.\nIn truth, working with a host of separate apps isn’t that different from manual planning using pen and paper.\nYou may use an order management system for your online grocery store, such as:\n Retail management systems; Retail POS (point of sale) software; Online grocery ordering stores and marketplaces; Online ordering apps; White-labelled grocery apps; And others.  Or you can connect it with an inventory management solution to track and order supplies.\nAnd any other tools you use for the supply chain, warehouse, or customer support.\nAll of these systems can integrate with grocery delivery software.\nThat means you can take a holistic approach to your delivery. And manage everything from one central platform.\nCoordinated pick-up \u0026amp; drop-off Thanks to real-time control and visibility, as well as complete integration, you can coordinate the pick-up and drop-off of each delivery.\nThat’s why you can use grocery delivery software regardless of whether you use an internal vs external delivery fleet.\nLet’s say you use a 3PL provider.\nFor example, you can integrate it with their tracking software to monitor the dedicated fleet as they deliver groceries to your customers.\nAnd you can just as well use it to coordinate pick-up with your suppliers. Or organize the in-store pick-up for click \u0026amp; collect.\nOn the other hand, you can orchestrate internal teams, as well.\nFor example, you can use the grocery delivery system to schedule pick-ups at depot locations.\nInventory managers can plan pick-up times based on the drivers’ delivery schedules.\nThat can prevent any overlaps at the depot site, which might create bottlenecks and slow down fulfilment.\nAnd it works regardless of whether you plan at a depot level vs multi-depot planning.\nPlus, you can do this for all of your teams, from route planners, to dispatch and customer support.\nFlexible \u0026amp; faster grocery delivery Aligning internal teams and integrating with different solutions makes your grocery delivery faster and more flexible.\nControlling tasks from a central platform means you manage every part of your organization.\nThat includes the structure, process, people, and technology.\nAnd you can do all of that on the go.\nThis active approach means you can make swift assessments, quick decisions, and take rapid action in various situations.\nAt the same time, you have complete visibility over all of your resources.\nThat makes it easier to readjust operations and align with the needs and requirements of your plan of action.\nNot only does this make your delivery faster and more flexible. But it’s also the first step to build an agile delivery operation.\nEfficient grocery delivery Grocery delivery software impacts all areas of your operations.\nThat improves key metrics in delivery logistics. And that\u0026rsquo;s what makes your delivery more efficient.\nFor example, when you raise on-time delivery and order accuracy, you boost customer satisfaction.\nSo more people feel driven to buy more groceries from you. (Rather than from rival stores)\nAt the same time, optimizing routes to cut the average time per delivery speeds up fulfilment.\nWhich means you can handle more deliveries. (Without investing extra resources)\nGreater efficiency helps you achieve three things:\nFirst, you improve performance\nBetter performance raises productivity and the amount of profit you can generate.\nThen, you optimize operations\nThat helps you maximize cost-effectiveness by reducing waste in your process. So you can make better use of what you have (your resources).\nAnd finally, you become more sustainable.\nFrom vehicle wear and tear to employee happiness, you protect your assets while conserving time, money, and energy.\nHow to choose a grocery delivery software? At this point in the article, you know pretty much everything there is to know about grocery delivery software.\nAnd you probably want one for your store.\nGreat!\nNow it’s time to check out the advanced characteristics that can help you make a better decision and choose the BEST solution.\nLet’s start.\nOnline grocery delivery software If we could give you one piece of advice to choose the best solution for your business, it’s this:\nChoose grocery delivery software that you can access online. That it’s a web-based solution.\nWhat this means is that you can access the software from anywhere, using a web browser like Google Chrome, Safari, Opera, or Firefox.\nOf course, these days, a lot of grocery delivery apps are web-based. But it’s still just as important, and for several reasons:\nFirst, delivery management software that’s web-based is much more affordable.\nInstead of buying a 10-times more expensive copy or license, you subscribe to use the software for a fixed period.\nUsually, this means a monthly or yearly subscription. So, you can terminate as soon as your contract expires.\nNext, all web-based solutions operate on the public cloud.\nCloud computing means that you won’t have to invest extra money into extra technology, systems integration, or software updates.\nAll of that is automatically rolled-out by your SaaS provider.\nAnd because it works on the cloud you can also:\n Easily collect, store, access, or recover data; Use the software from unlimited locations; Raise collaboration, mobility, and sustainability; Increase security and prevent the loss of data; Integrate with other systems and solutions.  And integration is the next property you should look for:\nAPI Integration We’ve touched on the integration of grocery delivery software quite a bit. But what does that look like exactly?\nSpecifically, delivery management software has to have API integration.\nAPI stands for application programming interface. Experts define it as:\n API integration is a connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that lets those systems exchange data between each other.\n Source: apifriends.com\nWithout APIs, grocery delivery software would be just another stand-alone app.\nThat’s why it’s important to check if the solution has API integration capabilities. But also whether it can integrate with both internal and external systems.\nAdditionally, you should check out how data will move between systems. And how secure is that movement of data.\nIf you plan to share APIs with customers and partners, there has to be a secure port and a system of verification, as well.\nQuick import \u0026amp; export of data Grocery delivery software should be able to handle multiple order requests at the same time.\nIt should also import and export delivery data automatically. Which means the software transfers the order requests into tasks by itself.\nWhen choosing a solution, make sure that the system allows you to upload files one by one and in bulk. And that it supports universal file formats (.xls, .pdf, .csv).\nKeep in mind that automatic import \u0026amp; export of data shouldn’t prevent you from doing it by hand. (Since you should always have a back-up plan)\nAutomated reporting Are you still manually planning?\nThen you know, how difficult it is for all your teams to submit reports, proofs of delivery, and order receipts.\nThen there is the way-too-long paper trail and all those cabinets that store those files.\nNow, imagine that you have a customer complaint. And you need to access a file, quickly.\nIt won’t be easy. (Even if you have a spreadsheet to help you)\nIt’s safe to assume that you need grocery delivery software with automated reporting.\nDelivery management software does this using:\n Electronic proof of delivery (ePOD); Historical data tracing, and; Automated notifications.  ePOD means that you can collect and store all your order requests, delivery confirmations, and shipping dockets within the system. (Both via the dashboard and driver app)\nHistorical data tracing, on the other hand, will allow you to access that data.\nYou can use it to evaluate your operations. Not to mention, expand your database to improve the accuracy of the system.\nFinally, you should check whether the software lets you set up automatic confirmations, alerts, and notifications.\nThat is crucial when you want to minimize internal communication, but also improve customer experience.\nMake sure the system supports in-app notifications, QR codes, email and SMS alerts.\nPrice Of course, price is a top factor when choosing delivery software for your grocery store.\nAnd it’s safe to assume that you want to spend the least amount of money for the highest gains and best features.\nSo, we did the math and compared prices.\nOn average, delivery management software costs $182.35, or £137.74.\nBut there is a lot that goes into the price. And a lot of providers that offer different solutions.\nThat’s why we did a deep dive into all of that.\nSo, you know the answer to the question: How much does delivery management software cost?\n(And how much you’ll end up paying once you’ve made your choice)\nOptimize your grocery delivery We have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

Plus, you’ll get a chance to see how you can leverage route planning and optimization to improve your delivery, like UPS.\nBut more on that later.\nRight now, the focus is all on UPS.\nSo, let’s get started.\nA culture of constructive dissatisfaction United Parcel Service (UPS) is a global powerhouse in last-mile delivery and logistics.\nWith more than a century of experience, the company today strives to evolve its culture of constructive dissatisfaction.\nAnd behind that culture is UPS' route optimization software.\nBuilt on advanced route optimization algorithms, it\u0026rsquo;s saving UPS large amounts of money while making the job easier for its workers.\nWith many benefits to the environment, as well.\nAfter more than a decade in development, the company has perfected a solution for what it believes is the biggest problem in modern delivery - route optimization and route planning.\nWhat routing software does UPS use? According to Juan Perez (UPS Chief Information and Engineering Officer):\n UPS drivers make an average of 125 stops each day.\n That\u0026rsquo;s a far cry from on-foot and bicycle delivery of packages 100 years ago.\nSecond, UPS drivers make deliveries to a lot of places, as well.\nSometimes, these locations aren\u0026rsquo;t easily accessible or visible from the main roads, which makes it hard to reach these places using traditional mapping software.\nNow, consider that UPS is a multinational company.\nIt handles entire shipments, deliveries, and distribution networks outside of the United States.\nIn more than 220 countries and territories in which it operates.\nWith more than 20 million global packages delivered daily.\nAnd the company employs more than 100,000 drivers, as well.\nThat would be impossible to do with manual planning or legacy tools.\nSo, to optimize multi-stop route planning for all these tasks, UPS had to develop its route planning software.\nTheir solution is ORION - On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation.\nWhat is UPS Orion? More than a decade in the making, Orion is a route planning app that uses a complex algorithm to optimize multi-drop route planning.\n Here’s a short video about UPS Orion.\n But before all of this had happened, there were years of continued investment and research.\nThe first significant implementation of the software came in 2013.\nAt the time, the company applied it to only 10,000 UPS routes.\nBut Orion\u0026rsquo;s performance turned out to be better than expected.\nSo, UPS had to speed up the scale of its US deployment, and the full launch came in 2016.\nThe company regularly rolls out new updates and improvements, but the system hasn’t changed much since then.\nAll this came at a price.\nUPS invested an estimated $1 billion per year into the project, making Orion one of the World\u0026rsquo;s largest projects of this kind.\nOne of the key moves by UPS in developing the app was installing GPS devices and vehicle sensors in its vehicles in 2008.\nBy tracking GPS locations, UPS gathered large amounts of data like vehicle routes and vehicles idle times.\nIn the end, all this data resulted in more than 1000 pages of code in the algorithm used by Orion.\nHow does it work? Orion uses countless amounts of data to help UPS drivers find the optimal way to deliver and pick-up packages.\nOrion calculates routes based on:\n The number of stops; Start time; Commit time; Pick up windows, and; Special customer requests.  Not only does it calculate the shortest distance between two locations, it also takes into account factors like fuel consumption and traffic.\nIt also uses an online map specifically customized by UPS to help its professionals in planning routes.\nDuring delivery, Orion can solve any alteration within the planned route in a matter of seconds.\nOrion is an online route optimization software.\nAnd while it is accessed via any device across UPS’ thousands of hubs, the physical servers are located in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nAll the data that drivers collect arrives here. It is then processed, and added to the system to improve the software, thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI).\nAnother part of UPS’ route optimization software is the drivers’ Delivery Information Acquisition Device (DIAD).\nDIAD is a handheld tool that drivers usually mount on the dashboard of their vehicles that allows hands-free use of Orion.\nIt was first introduced in 1991, and UPS is currently using the fifth generation of DIAD (with the sixth one in development).\nThe company also relies on UPSNav - the latest Orion update.\nUPSNav optimizes route delivery for drivers by providing precise details about locations, even when it comes to the point of entry at the pick-up and drop-off sites.\nSolving the Traveling Salesman Problem What is the shortest possible route between multiple points which you can reach before returning to the starting point?\nThis question is the basis of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).\nFirst formulated in the early 20th century, the Travelling Salesman Problem is crucial not only in logistics but in numerous other fields such as computer sciences, operations research and, to some degree, even in DNA sequencing.\nWhen applying it to two stops, the problem is pretty straight-forward.\nBut with more than 100 stops per day that UPS drivers make, the possibilities are endless. And the problem, a Gordian knot.\nFor example, with 10 locations there can be around 300,000 combinations. Increase the number of destinations to 15, and you get more than 87 billion permutations.\nBecause of this, it isn\u0026rsquo;t hard to realize that optimizing routes for any large number of stops is close to humanly impossible.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s where advanced algorithms, coding, and AI come into play to form route optimization apps.\nJust as dividing two three-digit numbers takes our brains at least a couple of seconds, it\u0026rsquo;s almost instantaneous for a basic calculator.\nA similar thing happens with route planning optimization.\nBut as we mentioned earlier, a critical part of the whole problem-solving is the input of the correct data.\nOrion can give UPS drivers an optimal route in a matter of seconds thanks to years of quality data input into an algorithm that Orion and UPSNav use.\nOrion lets you update or correct its online maps in real-time if delivery or pick-up points change during live operations.\nThat is essential for perfecting how route planners work.\nOn the other hand, AI steps in to utilize all of this data to find the best possible path for a driver to make his drop-offs/pick-ups.\nOf course, before Orion, and before AI, drivers or other workers planned routes by themselves.\nBut solving the TSP with the amount of deliveries UPS does daily in an efficient manner is virtually an impossible task for drivers.\nNot only that, it would be time-consuming as well.\nBy using Orion, UPS enables their drivers to focus on driving and delivery, without the additional distraction of planning delivery routes.\nThe benefits of route optimization software Modern vehicles have AI systems that use complicated algorithms to improve driver safety beyond human capabilities.\nOur phones have apps that help us with tedious, everyday tasks, and make them easy to do.\nSo, it stands to reason that we should use software and apps to make delivery route optimization easier, as well.\nThat’s why UPS had invested billions of dollars to develop Orion.\nSeeing the results, it’s safe to say that it was money well spent.\nBut route optimization software is now available to all companies, regardless of their shape, size, or industry.\nNow, every business can profit and improve its delivery just like UPS.\nAnd to know what results you can expect, here are the main benefits of route optimization apps and how you can get a quick return like UPS:\nShorter delivery times The Oxford Dictionary describes optimization as:\n The action of making the best or most effective use of a situation or resource.\n So it’s quite obvious that one of the main benefits of using a route optimization app is a better use of your resources.\nBy using Orion, UPS is first and foremost saving time. And we all know that saving time is saving money.\nTheir drivers have clearly defined and exact routes from point A to point B, as well as detailed turn-by-turn instructions on how to get there.\nThat ensures all they have to do is focus on driving to the next drop-off or pick-up point.\nBy organizing multiple destinations into the best possible route, Orion makes life easier for everyone involved – drivers, operators, route planners, but customers as well.\nConsider how the speed of delivery means customers wait less for their order to arrive.\nWith faster delivery, customers are bound to spend more and order more products.\nThat raises the income of any business that leverages the power of route optimization software.\nFuel consumption Better route optimization means shorter distances vehicles have to travel, which means less fuel consumption.\nUPS says Orion is saving them about 100 million miles per year. That\u0026rsquo;s around 10 million gallons of fuel.\nThe average price for a gallon of fuel in the US is around $2.5.\nSo, the math here is pretty clear.\nLikewise, UPS has a Don’t turn left policy, which was introduced back in the 1970s.\nThe idea is that the vehicles should avoid going against the flow of traffic and avoid making left turns.\nWhen turning left, the vehicle has to wait for cross-traffic to pass, which wastes both time and fuel.\nOrion route optimization takes this into account, as well.\nIt creates paths with more right turns, which makes each route even more fuel-efficient and cost-effective.\nUPS estimates it saves them additional 10 million gallons a year.\nLastly, reducing fuel consumption also means fewer carbon emissions.\nUPS estimates that\u0026rsquo;s around 100,000 metric tons of CO2 a year, so it\u0026rsquo;s an added benefit for the environment.\nBetter fleet utilization Whether your company has a couple of vans or 125,000 as UPS, it’s in your best interest to make your vehicles remain operational as long as possible.\nFleet route optimization means fewer miles travelled.\nThat translates to extended use of each vehicle, and less wear and tear. And that makes each vehicle in your fleet more reliable.\nBut every vehicle needs regular service and maintenance, as well. And that’s another cost you have to take into account.\nHowever, decreasing the miles travelled also minimizes the chance of malfunction, and reduces the need for constant repairs.\nBe it a flat tire or something more serious, like a breakdown.\nAll in all, UPS estimates that Orion saves them $400 million per year on vehicle maintenance alone.\nMaking the job easier for drivers Because of route planning software, UPS drivers focus more on driving and deliveries.\nAs we mentioned before, they make more than 100 stops per day. That’s a lot of responsibility as is.\nHaving to worry about traffic or which way to go at the next intersection would make their day a lot more complicated.\nLess experienced drivers benefit the most, here.\nWhenever drivers start a new delivery route, having an app that tells them where and when to turn to reach a customer’s address makes their job a whole lot easier.\nCustomer satisfaction Any business move you take has to serve and satisfy your customers.\nRoute optimization software makes deliveries and pick-ups more organized. But it also makes your customers happier.\nA route planning app that can navigate a driver through alternative roads to a drop-off site but also provide customers with precise ETA updates in real-time, is a win-win situation.\nThat makes it easier for customers to plan their day around other responsibilities, rather than the delivery itself.\nIn return, it reduces the need for extra communication between your customer support teams and customers.\nAnd that lowers the frustration of everyone involved.\nWhat is the best route planning software? It’s safe to assume that any route planning software has to have multi-stop route planning capabilities.\nBut it has to have it well-developed and advanced, as well.\nFor example, Google Maps has a multi-stop route planning feature.\nBut it’s pretty basic when compared to Orion. And the number of stops is limited.\nControl over fuel consumption is paramount, as well.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s one of the most consistent costs of running a delivery, as well as an essential one.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t afford to leave out the exact and precise numbers when calculating key metrics in delivery logistics, such as fuel consumption.\nHaving a fleet of vehicles adds another factor.\nBe it an internal vs external fleet, you have to have an app that can organize drivers without overlaps in their schedules or delivery areas.\nAnd all of this needs to happen in an optimal amount of time.\nIf you have an app that calculates routes in tens of minutes, rather than seconds, you can find yourself in trouble when you have to make swift decisions.\nIf one of your vehicles breaks down, for example, you have to reassign other drivers to that route or drop-off to make up for the loss.\nSo having an app that can do this quickly is also essential for building an agile delivery operation.\nBut not all companies are UPS.\nNor do they have the resources of UPS.\nNor are they global leaders in the delivery logistics.\nFortunately for you, there are other apps out there that can get the job done extremely well and at a much lower cost.\neLogii is one such solution.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

More precisely:\n How much do prices vary on the market; What is and what isn’t included in the cost; What makes up the cost in the first place; And how to determine how much you’ll pay.  Plus, we’ll show you how you can make your last-mile delivery more cost-effective today.\n(But more on that later)\nRight now, let’s first take a look at what exactly is delivery management software.\nWhat is delivery management software? Delivery management software (DMS) is a logistics tool used for managing the entire delivery operation. That includes route planning, route optimization, fleet, vehicle, and driver managing, scheduling pick-ups and drop-offs, and reverse logistics.\nThanks to API integration, delivery management software can connect to other essential logistics tools, including:\n Website or web store Order management systems Inventory management software Telematics systems  Integrating the software with other systems enables you to take a holistic approach to manage the entire supply chain. And without the need to switch between multiple apps.\nDelivery management software is a centralized system, as well.\nSo whether you choose to use it is a question of whether to centralize or not to centralize delivery operations.\nAt any rate, it enables you to control the entire life cycle of each delivery using just one platform. From the moment you source it until your driver places it in your customer’s hands.\nUsually, the delivery management platform has two main components:\n Dashboard: the central platform where you have complete visibility and control over all aspects of the delivery; Driver app (for Android and iOS): an integrated delivery app which allows teams (drivers and delivery agents) to use data and tools in the field.  Depending on the software, you can gain access to several different features and capabilities:\n Route optimization Depot optimization Driver management Delivery scheduling Live operations management Live tracking Customer management Customer notification Vehicle capacity control Electronic proof of delivery And much more  In brief, delivery management software is an end-to-end solution for handling logistics that gives you all the tools necessary to satisfy the demands and requirements of your delivery operations.\nThat includes setting up and integrating the system with your delivery and making it ready for use.\nNow that you know what is delivery management software, how much is it worth?\nThe cost of delivery management software There are a lot of options available to you when choosing delivery software for your business.\nBut to give you a better understanding of the cost, we did a little research. And based on our comparative analysis, here’s what we found:\nOn average, the price of delivery management software is $182.35 per month.\nBut a lot of factors determine the price of delivery management software.\nEach provider has its price per subscription and a different billing method. And that makes things complicated for you.\nSo, we simplified things a little.\nWe took a basic delivery model and calculated the price of a subscription for a business that operates five vehicles and completes 1000 deliveries per month.\nBased on those parameters, we were able to consolidate the prices of the delivery management software on the market.\nAnd this is what we found out:\nOnfleet: $149.00/month\nRoute4me: $149.00/month\neLogii: $159.00/month\nTookan: $159.00/month\nOptimoroute: $175.50/month\nRoutific: $195.00/month\nGetswift: $290.00/month\nOf course, this price comparison doesn’t give you the complete picture.\nMost of these solutions are different from one another based on the actual billing method and the features they include.\nSome providers bill subscribers per delivery (Getswift), while others do it per vehicle (Routific) or driver (Optimoroute).\nMost base their price according to a subscription plan (eLogii, Onfleet, Tookan, Route4me), including SaaS companies with quote-based plans like Bringg.\nSome providers don’t include all of the features and capabilities in their offers and bill them separately.\nHowever, most, if not all of the companies offer monthly or annual billing.\nBut how do you know whether the cost is worth it?\nTo answer that, let’s take a closer look at what influences the price.\nWhat determines the cost of delivery management software? There are a lot of things to consider when figuring out the cost of delivery management software.\nFor starters, there are a lot of solutions available from which to choose.\nIn fact, if you do a quick search on Capterra, there are more than 80 reviews of the delivery management software.\nSource: Capterra.com\nEach one of those systems has a different price.\nEach one of them also has a different feature list. Not to mention, other factors determine their price, as well.\nBut we’ve narrowed it down for you. And we chose three main factors that we believe affect the price of delivery management software the most.\nHere’s what we have considered:\n1. Features Features and capabilities of a solution determine the price of delivery management software.\nIf you’re looking for delivery software for small business, then you may be satisfied with the basic features. So, the price will be affordable.\nIf, on the other hand, you are looking for an enterprise-grade solution, the cost can increase significantly. The same is true if you need specific or custom add-ons.\nFor example, eLogii has 59 unique features.\nThis is only a list of our routing and planning capabilities:\n See the full list of features and capabilities of our software.\n But some of our customers don’t need to use all of them.\nThat’s why we have different business options available.\nSo you can find the best solution based on the size and shape of your delivery and the nature of your industry.\nAt the same time, some solutions are more specialized for various logistics operations.\nFor example, you might need a system for carrier shipping, global supply chain management, transportation management, or truck tracking.\nThat will also affect the price.\nTechnically, the more complex the logistical needs of your operations are, the more robust the software needs to be. And the higher the price you will have to pay.\nBut the cost isn’t just about features. It’s defined by other things, as well. Like deployment.\n2. Software deployment (on-premise vs SaaS) There are two kinds of software deployment when it comes to delivery management apps: on-premise and software as a service (SaaS).\nTypically, on-premise solutions are more expensive than SaaS.\nWith on-premise delivery management software, you purchase the perpetual license or a sanctioned copy of the software. And you use your private digital infrastructure to operate the system.\nSo, on-premise software solutions have enormous capital expenditure (Capex).\nAnd although operating expenses (Opex) are low, you still have to purchase software updates. So there are extra costs every time the provider rolls out a new upgrade.\nBy contrast, SaaS-based solutions are much more affordable.\nInstead of paying a large sum upfront, adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics means you subscribe to use the software.\nFor a monthly or annual subscription, you get access to the software via the public cloud.\nSo, there are no Capex requirements in terms of infrastructure, software updates, or systems integration. All of that is automatically rolled-out.\nHowever, Opex is substantially higher due to the subscription. But only over a lengthy period.\nThat’s why a contract with a SaaS provider is typically the more affordable choice than an on-premise alternative.\nBut the contract also determines how much you will pay.\nSo, let’s take a look at how the subscription plan affects the price.\n3.The length of your contract After you’ve decided on what type of software you want and the features it has to have, it’s time to draw up a contract.\nThat is an ideal chance for you to lower the price of your subscription because the size and length of your contract determine the cost of delivery management software.\nIn some cases, providers offer subscriptions that include 12, 24, 36-month contracts.\nTo incentivize long-term commitment, the longer the contract lasts, the more affordable the terms of your agreement.\nBut the price also depends on whether you want to get billed monthly or annually.\nTypically, the price is 20% lower if you decide to get billed annually.\nAnd then there is the pay-as-you-go pricing plan:\nPay as you go If you are unsure about a solution, you can choose the pay-as-you-go pricing model.\nPay as you go is a highly flexible payment model. It allows you to terminate the contract at any time regardless of the package you choose.\nAt the same time, it allows you to scale quickly.\nWith pay-as-you-go, you can switch between pricing plans depending on your need to upscale or downscale the cost of operations.\nFor example, you can reduce the cost of your subscription if you experience lower order volumes (such as the case with the state of last-mile delivery in time of the coronavirus).\nOn the other hand, you can subscribe to a higher-tier package and gain advanced functionality when demand exceeds your capacity.\nHowever, this comes at a price.\nBecause of its many benefits, the cost of a delivery management software subscription is 35% higher with a pay-as-you-go pricing plan.\nBut there is another aspect to your contract that you need to consider.\n4. The size of your contract When talking about the size of the contract, we mean:\n the number of deliveries (or tasks) you intend to create, or; the number of drivers and vehicles in your fleet.  Providers calculate this price per month regardless of the length of your subscription.\nOn the other hand, some providers take a different approach.\nSome SaaS companies design specific plans based on:\n business requirements; size of operations; expected order volumes.  Typically, these pricing plans cater to various types of organizations:\n startups small-to-medium businesses enterprises  Let’s briefly take a closer look at each option:\nCost per task (or delivery) per month The core function of any delivery management platform is a task. Each task represents a delivery which you assign to a driver using the dashboard on your account.\nOn average, the cost per task is between $0.10 and $0.25.\nFor enterprise-grade solutions, the average cost per task can be as high as $1.00.\nIf you have fixed routes and know exactly how many deliveries you will complete per month, then this option is for you.\nOtherwise, you risk exceeding the budget in times when order volumes skyrocket, like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or the Christmas shopping season.\n Here’s a free guide on how to prepare last-mile delivery logistics for Black Friday.\n Cost per driver Some software providers charge subscriptions according to the number of drivers in your fleet.\nEach driver represents a user (or delivery agent) on the dashboard.\nIn some cases, providers limit the number of users you can create. That prevents you from implementing tactics to grow your delivery operations and scaling your organization.\nIn others, this number doesn’t impact the cost of your subscription at all. Instead, you can use it as one of the key metrics in delivery logistics to determine the cost-effectiveness of your fleet.\nThe cost of delivery management software per driver varies a lot and can be between $2.00 and $35.00.\nSo, there is a lot for you to consider.\nLuckily, many SaaS companies provide a solution for that, as well.\n5. Free Trials Free trials help you test the capabilities of the software in real-life situations before you commit to a long-term contract.\nThat is an advantage of cloud-based solutions. You can immediately create an account online and start using the software just as if you had a paid subscription.\nWhen you start the free trial, usually, you receive a tutorial and a live demonstration of the software properties.\nIn general, a delivery management software free trial is a limited offer. Typically, you gain access to a trial version that lasts for two weeks (14 days).\nOnce it ends, you can choose to subscribe or continue your search with no strings attached.\nAnd get the best value out of delivery management software.\nMake your delivery cost-effective We have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

(But more on that later)\nRight now, if you’re looking to find the best routes for your drivers, save money by boosting efficiency, or an easier way to plan and manage your operations, we have you covered.\nLet’s get started.\nWhat is route optimization software? Route optimization software is a digital tool used to automatically calculate the best and most efficient paths (or routes) between multiple stops (or deliveries) for various vehicles and drivers.\nBut how does route optimization software work?\nTo do that route optimization software uses a set of complex algorithms to factor in more than just the distance between two stops.\nIt calculates the best route based on multiple constraints, like:\n Types of roads (urban roads vs highways; single vs double vs multi lanes; one-way vs two-way streets); Traffic patterns (daily (rush hours) or seasonal (Christmas rush) traffic congestion, detours, roadworks, closed roads); Number of road crossings, roundabouts, traffic junctions, and stop lights en route; Crossing the line of traffic (left-hand (US) or right-hand (UK) turns); Pick-ups (wait time to pick up products, supplies, equipment, or field service workers); Depot locations (mapping multiple pick-ups at multiple depot sites); Determining the best access points (to enter or exit a street, road, or highway); Driver schedules (rest stops, lunch breaks, shifts); Vehicle type (speed, fuel consumption, cargo capacity); Delivery windows (exact deadlines, dates, times of delivery, urgent deliveries, fixed deliveries, regular weekly deliveries);  So isn’t just about finding the shortest route between point A and point B.\nRoute optimization is also about determining the most efficient route based on the demands of your customers and operations.\nNow you know what route optimization software is.\nSo let’s see what you need to look for when you want to choose the best option for your SMB.\nHow to choose route optimization software? Now that you know what it is, how do you choose route optimization software?\nTo answer that question, ask yourself: What do you want? And what do you need?\nTake a moment to evaluate your operations. See how many vehicles you have in your fleet, and how many will you add in the next couple of years.\nHow many deliveries do you handle per week, month, or year? Calculate delivery order volumes to get a better understanding of how many tasks you’ll enter on any given day into the system.\nWhat about the delivery area which you cover? See how many kilometres your drivers cover daily. Is there room for improvement?\nOr do you want to cut the costs of operations? In that case, you might want to calculate the average cost of your delivery. Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick formula to help you:\n Read this post to see how delivery management software cuts costs and saves you money.\n Besides this and the obvious things you typically look at like price and functionality, there are some features every routing software should have.\nIf it’s your first time researching this type of solution, you have to be aware of them.\nLuckily, we’re here to help.\nHere are 15 features of route optimization software should have:\n1. Online route optimization software (web-based) The route optimization software you choose should be accessible via the web.\nBut what does that mean?\nUsing route optimization software online means that users can log in straight into their accounts when they access the software via their browser.\nSimply put, all you have to do is go to the provider’s website using your browser (Google Chrome, Safari, or Firefox), input the username and password in the login screen, and you are all set.\nThat’s it.\nIt may seem intuitive to you, but without web-based software, it is almost impossible to achieve pure real-time tracking.\nIt also makes it simpler to keep the software up-to-date.\nMany legacy or on-premise solutions can’t support this feature. So, it’s up to you to install and update the app manually from your desktop or smartphone.\nAdopting a cloud-first approach to delivery management means that the provider automatically updates the software.\nAs soon as you sign up and log in, you can access the dashboard and start using the software.\n2. Multi-drop route planning Make sure the software you choose has a multi-drop route planning feature. That capability is the backbone of any successful route planning.\nBut what is it?\nMulti-drop route planning is a term in last-mile delivery logistics that describes the process of planning multiple routes with multiple delivery stops (or drop-offs).\nIf you’ve ever used Google Maps to create a travel itinerary of all the sites you want to visit on your trip, it’s a similar process.\nBut unlike making a travel plan, it’s a little more complicated than that.\nMapping multiple delivery stops is impossible to do without route optimization software. So it’s a crucial feature you should seek out.\nIf you are unable to add automatically or manually multiple drop-offs to your route, you won’t be able to plan or manage many deliveries.\nYour drivers will have to move back and forth between the supply depot and the customer’s address after each drop-off is complete.\nOn the other hand, you won’t be able to increase the route density of your delivery. And that can prevent you from using other delivery tactics to grow your operations.\n3. Multi-route and multi-vehicle routing When you want to manage a field service operation or last-mile delivery, usually you have more than one vehicle in your fleet.\nSo, it’s safe to assume that you need a tool that can map multiple routes for all of those vehicles.\nHaving route optimization software that can map multiple routes for multiple vehicles allows you to plan deliveries for the entire fleet. And from one dashboard.\nSo, it’s also a question of whether to centralize or not to centralize delivery operations.\nA centralized software solution can raise the visibility over your operation and makes it easier to optimize the fleet, end to end.\nIt also means that you cut the time it takes your route planners to assign deliveries to drivers. That leaves a lot more room in their schedules to focus on other tasks.\nAt the same time, route optimization software automates this process.\nFleet managers can assign, re-assign, and re-route drivers at a moment’s notice and according to demand.\nSo you can cut the time it takes to fulfil requests and increase the speed of delivery. Maybe even to the extent that you start offering same-day delivery.\nBut this brings us to another point.\n4. Fast processing of route optimization The rise of Amazon fulfilment has changed the status quo of last-mile delivery.\nIf you want to know how to compete with Amazon delivery and other last-mile delivery giants, you need to raise the speed of your operations. And that includes how fast you plan routes.\nRoute planning and route optimization have to be fast.\nThat’s why you need to route optimization software in the first place.\nBut not all software is alike. So, when choosing a provider, the process of optimizing routes has to happen rapidly and in real-time.\nWithout this feature, it’s impossible to plan and schedule deliveries as orders arrive. But neither can you efficiently manage drivers once they set off on their routes.\n Read this article if you want to find out how to plan better delivery schedules.\n If you are considering software that takes a few minutes to find an optimal route per request, then that solution is of no use, and you should look elsewhere.\n5. Import \u0026amp; export route data Are you still planning manually routes?\nIf you’re out to buy route optimization software, then your delivery is probably growing. And your route planner can’t keep up with the increase in order volumes.\nWhen demand exceeds your capacity, route optimization software can help you automate the process.\n Read How to improve last-mile delivery when demand exceeds capacity.\n Route optimization software allows you to handle multiple order requests at once without the need to import deliveries manually; or export route data by hand.\nSo, when evaluating different solutions, it’s crucial to check with the provider whether the software can easily import and export route data.\nUsually, this means that you can upload files directly into the system.\nThe software can then automatically transfer order requests into tasks, and you can assign deliveries to drivers.\nMake sure that the software you choose can support universal formats:\n .xls files .pdf files .csv files  At the same time, the software should also allow you to manually import or export tasks, as well.\nIn case of unexpected situations or unplanned deliveries, you always want to have a back-up plan.\nSo even with full automation, your route planners can achieve maximum efficiency through their insight, experience, and know-how.\n6. API integration The state of delivery in time of the coronavirus has prompted many companies to move their offers online.\nNow, you too may also have several different sales channels open to consumers including:\n your website a web store (Shopify account) social media networks a marketplace account (Amazon, eBay, Etsy, etc.)  If you provide delivery with each sale, it’s safe to say that you use an order management tool to handle all of these requests.\nAt the same time, if you own and operate the delivery yourself (vs using a 3PL company), you may be using other solutions to manage inventory, dispatch drivers or manage the supply chain.\nIt’s safe to assume that adding route optimization software to the list would make it harder to keep track of operations.\nThat’s why you have to check whether the software you are considering has API integration.\nSimply put, APIs let you connect one piece of software with another.\nFor example, if you’re on Shopify, you can integrate the account and order management system with a route optimization platform.\nIn this scenario, the Shopify OMS can add orders to the dashboard of the delivery management system as tasks. While your teams assign them to drivers and plan routes based on that data.\nAnd when you can do this with all your tools, you can plan, route, manage and dispatch the entire last-mile delivery from one central platform.\nMake sure that the software provider has all of the API documentation prepared, as well. And that they provide support during the implementation. (But more on that later)\n7. Live map updates Live delivery tracking and management are one of the biggest delivery challenges in eCommerce.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s impossible to achieve real-time visibility without live map updates.\nOn the one hand, live map updates let you track drivers and deliveries once they set off on their routes.\nThat makes it easier to monitor progress, and keep track of key metrics in delivery logistics.\nOn the other hand, you can connect routing software with a third-party traffic monitoring system.\nUp-to-date mapping allows you to foresee conditions that are out of your control so you can plan for them ahead of time.\nSo make sure that this capability is available to you.\n8. Geocoding What is geocoding? Geocoding is the main component of all route optimization software. It’s what enables routing software to map the precise latitude and longitude when mapping coordinates. While at the same time, understanding imprecise addresses and local contexts of the delivery area.\nGeocoding is what enables you to accurately locate and convert any address into a particular point on the map when using route planning software.\nIf geocoding isn’t accurate, the software will struggle to map the best route for your drivers.\nHaving a database of local addresses, and adding them to the system helps with greater accuracy.\nBut speak to the provider about geocoding on their software. And check how accurate it is.\n9. Historical data tracing The software you choose should support historical data tracing.\nHistorical data tracing allows you to collect data from past experiences and examine them and further improve the performance of your teams.\nWith quality data tracing, you should be able to collect:\n Driver histories Completed deliveries Past delivery locations Preferred time windows Special customer instructions Prevailing traffic patterns Driver workloads Open-close hours And more.  10. Auto-save functionality Some things are beyond your control. Systems can fail, and technical errors can occur when you least expect it. And that can seriously interfere with your ability to effectively plan routes.\nAny reliable route optimization software must have auto-save functionality.\nIf something unexpected happens to the system, for example, a power outage or a cyber attack, autosave ensures that the current work isn’t lost.\nThis removes a lot of the stress from your route planners.\nBecause the data is frequently saved, your professionals can rest assured that it’s secure and accessible once the system goes back online.\nMake sure that the SaaS company you choose provides suitable storage space. And that all the data is encrypted and stored securely via the cloud.\n11. Automated reporting Automated reporting is a must-have feature of any apt route optimization system.\nFirst, it removes the need for any paperwork. No need to print receipts, order confirmations, or proof of delivery.\nAll solid routing platforms have built-in electronic proof of delivery (ePOD).\nOnce orders are delivered, customers can confirm it and the software can automatically update the status on those tasks.\nAt the same time, the need to improve customer experience has become the new battleground in which to compete in recent years. So quality solutions should be able to report to customers, as well.\nThis means that the software dashboard allows you to set up automatic confirmations, alerts, and notifications.\nFor example, when an order is packaged for delivery, or when a driver is en route to the customer’s address, the system should automatically send out this information.\nLastly, check how and where all reports are stored; whether they are accessible later; can they be exported into a file (i.e. .pdf file); and can they be printed out if necessary.\n12. Driver app The modern last-mile delivery is all about mobility. And the key to building an agile delivery operation is communication.\nA driver app allows drivers, delivery agents, couriers, or field service agents to stay in constant contact with your teams at the office while on their routes.\nHaving a driver app that’s directly connected to the routing platform makes it easy for drivers to access relevant data, including information about:\n Routes Delivery windows Addresses Orders Customers Specific demands And more  A driver app streamlines internal communication between teams, as well.\nDispatchers can seamlessly add tasks and manage delivery schedules without talking to drivers. While the app notifies drivers about new tasks and impending deliveries.\nEveryone remains on point and in the loop without the need to relay information back and forth.\nThat means more time to complete tasks, more tasks get done, and greater productivity across the board.\nSo make sure the software comes with a driver app. And that it’s a route optimization app for Android and iOS.\n13. User-friendly interface Besides its many capabilities, route optimization software should also have a quality design.\nUI design makes the software visually accessible and easier to use.\nStandard UI features on the dashboard, like drag-and-drop and one-click to select, lower the learning curve.\nEmployees can learn how to use route optimization software sooner because they are already familiar with its functionalities through the various other apps that they have on their phones and desktops.\nBecause of a quality UI interface, time to adoption is lower, which reduces turnaround so you can achieve ROI much sooner.\nAnd when it’s easier to master a route optimization tool, you can train more employees to use it.\nYou won’t have to rely on a dedicated professional. Instead, anyone on your team can plan the routes.\nSo that daily tasks continue per schedule, even when your route planner is unavailable.\n14. Price We know that the price of the solution you are considering will largely influence your decision to buy it.\nHow much does route optimization software cost? The standard cost of feature-rich route optimization software for small business is no more than $10 per driver per month. For higher tier and enterprise-grade solutions, the price can be over $100 per driver per month.\nThere is a lot that depends on how much you will actually end up paying.\nMost of the time, SaaS companies set the cost of route optimization software based on a few key parameters.\nUsually, this includes the number of tasks, drivers, or vehicles you want to manage per month, as well as the complexity (number of features) of the solution.\nLikewise, the price depends on the payment plan you choose, as well as the features you want to subscribe to.\nFor example, SaaS companies offer special discounts if you subscribe to their software for more than 12 months. The same principles apply when you want them to bill you annually vs monthly.\nOn the other hand, what many companies, especially smaller businesses, fail to realize is that you can reduce or increase the price based on the features you add or remove from your plan.\nIf you know that you don’t want or don’t need a specific function, be sure to ask for a discount.\n15. Support After you settle on a route planning solution, you still have to implement the software, train staff, and integrate it with your other tools.\nEven with a tech-savvy in-house developer, you will need help navigating the maze of systems configuration before you can set up the software and get it online.\nIt’s vital that you have access to the right technical support.\nThat is a crucial part of choosing a delivery route planner. Without assistance from the tech team, you can\u0026rsquo;t take full advantage of all of its advanced functionality.\nBefore you sign a contract with a software provider, make sure that they:\n Offer a free trial (with support) Provide a demo of the software Provide access to tech staff Provide technical documentation Answer all of your questions Help with the integration Provide unlimited and ongoing support  If the software provider is ready to meet you on all of these accounts, then there is no reason why you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t place your trust in them.\n***\nThose are the fifteen things you need to consider when choosing route optimization software.\nAnd now when you know what to look for, consider this:\neLogii eLogii is more than route optimization software.

For everyone else in the world, that means Black Friday is near.\nAnd this year, Black Friday will be different. Like everything else in 2020.\nPerhaps we won’t see people camped in front of stores from 4 AM. Or the miles of queues. Or fights over a 50% discount. Or perhaps we will?\nWith the COVID-19 outbreak gathering strength for a second global wave, it will surely hit retailers, their customers, and sales this Black Friday.\nStill, a New Normal is upon us. People and businesses are adapting. And they will have to continue adapting all through November whatever happens next. But one thing is sure:\nPeople will shop on Black Friday. And more than ever before, the majority of those sales will happen online.\nRetailers can see their sales soar through the roof. Maybe it won’t be like last year, but it will be a giant leap forward from the rest of 2020.\nBut if Black Friday was a logistical nightmare before the coronavirus, this years’ sales spree will be hell on Earth. At least for warehouse, delivery, operations, and supply chain managers.\nAnd with little over a month left to go, we think it’s a good time to start the final preparation.\nThat’s why in this post we take a closer look at the last-mile delivery logistics behind Black Friday 2020.\nLet’s get started.\nWhen is Black Friday 2020? Black Friday is on 27 November 2020.\nBut like everything else this year, things are different.\nBlack Friday 2020 is less of daylong shopping madness and more a shopping frame of mind.\nMany retailers plan to extend their deals beyond 27 November. And even beyond November. All through to December, until Christmas Day 2020.\nSo everything is a bit of a blur. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Cyber Week, and Cyber Month will merge into Cyber Season.\nAmazon’s decision to move Prime Day to 13-14 October can mean that the winter sales season has already begun.\nBut Black Friday is a critical date in the sales calendar. One both you and your customers have come to expect.\nWith the second wave of COVID-19 to trigger another round of lockdowns, you can’t risk disappointing more customers or missing out on a chance to fatten up your revenue for the long winter ahead.\nSo, now that we’ve established when is Black Friday (27 November 2020), let’s see some predictions about how exactly it will be different this year.\nBlack Friday Predictions for 2020 To show you just how the coronavirus has affected things this year, we have to shed light on key predictions about Black Friday 2020.\nThat’s why we’ve collected the most frequent questions retailers (including some of our clients) had about it.\nHere are the most asked questions and the main predictions for Black Friday 2020:\nIs Black Friday 2020 Cancelled? No, Black Friday is NOT cancelled.\nIn a bestblackfriday.com report, most major retailers in the United States have decided to close their stores for Thanksgiving. But only their physical locations.\nThat doesn’t mean they have cancelled Black Friday.\nIn fact, many retailers (including Walmart, Best Buy, and Target) will open their stores on 27 November.\nStill, many more will host online shopping events that will kick off on Black Friday but extend throughout the winter sales season.\nShould you avoid Black Friday this year? Definitely, NOT.\nBlack Friday and Cyber Monday remain terrific chances to pump up sales' revenues in a year where many continue to struggle in keeping up with the New Normal.\nWith that said, many countries around the world are taking new measures to tackle the second wave of coronavirus.\nA new round of lockdowns is a possibility you have to consider.\nThis Black Friday, focus more energy on promoting offers on your website and create deals that entice customers to stay home and shop online.\nShould you extend Black Friday deals? It depends.\nThe biggest factor you have to consider is your supply chain.\nIf suppliers can’t keep up with your demand, or you lack the capacity to consistently fulfil orders, then don’t. Only plan those two 24-hour sprints on 27 and 30 November.\n Read this article if you want to know how to improve last-mile delivery when demand exceeds your capacity.\n At the same time, you also have to take into account what your competitors are doing.\nAmazon’s delay of Prime Day has prompted many retailers big and small to push their sales events earlier.\nFor example, Walmart created a shopping event called Big Save that took place from 11 to 15 October, while Target hosted its Deals Day during Prime Day (13 and 14 October).\nWhat many smaller retailers are also doing is creating deals around their best selling products and extending them beyond Black Friday.\nThis is helping them move past the problem of a static supply chain, making them competitive even with giants like Amazon, Walmart, and the rest.\n Here’s our free guide if you want to know more about how to compete with Amazon delivery.\n What sales numbers can you expect? Unfortunately, this is an answer no one can predict.\nBased on recent delivery statistics, there is a definite increase in online sales and orders from across the world. So, you can expect significantly more online orders in 2020.\nHowever, the impact of COVID-19 on the economy is much worse than the 2008 financial crash.\nIn an interview for digitalcommerce360.com, a financial editor from Bloomberg had said:\n “Retailers also should prepare for a sluggish holiday season overall–online and offline. So, this is a good time for retailers to talk with landlords, bankers and suppliers about contingency plans in case they hit a serious cash crunch.”\n Many people are without work and because of that spending-power has dramatically decreased when compared to last year.\nSo despite the history and hype around Black Friday, don’t expect your sales’ numbers to swell in 2020.\nBut even so, you will still need to take this opportunity and generate at least some gains from this year. Let’s take a look at how to set up your delivery for Black Friday 2020:\nHow to adjust delivery for Black Friday 2020? This year, a big chunk of Black Friday sales will take place online. So it’s safe to assume that delivery will be a critical battleground for winning over customers and their wallets.\nYour goal has to be to provide value with every order and to raise customer experience with every delivery to new heights.\nOf course, it isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be easy. If you take a look at statistics, most shoppers buy from a marketplace (like Amazon) because of:\n Better prices (67%) Free and discounted shipping (63%) Speed of delivery (45%)  So, two out of three factors have something to do with delivery.\nHere is what else makes customers choose a marketplace over your retail business:\nSource: digitalcommerce360.com\nBut Black Friday is a little different.\nUnlike the rest of the year, on the fourth Friday of November people shop more because of great deals. If you give them a better deal, your customers won’t mind paying for delivery since the value is already there.\nBut to take full advantage of all the potential around Black Friday, you should give customers what they want. So, let\u0026rsquo;s start by going over your delivery options.\nHere is what customers expect to see in the 2020 holiday season when it comes to delivery:\nSame-day and next-day delivery Fast delivery is the new expectation, thanks to Amazon.\nCustomers no longer want to wait more than two days for their purchase to arrive. The good news is that they are willing to pay for faster delivery.\nEven as a small retailer, you can offer next-day or even same-day delivery and cover the cost of fulfilment if you put the right price on those options.\n Here’s our free guide on how to provide same-day delivery with delivery management software.\n It\u0026rsquo;s worth having faster options open to customers at a price if they are already getting a discount on their purchase.\nFree delivery Free delivery is rarely free. Someone has to cover the cost of fulfilment. And it’s either you or your customer that bears the cost of free shipping.\nHere’s our free guide on how to offer free delivery to your customers without breaking the bank.\nHowever, keep free delivery locked for Black Friday deals and keep it open on your regular sales offer.\nThis way, you might entice some customers to purchase goods that don’t fall under the Black Friday label.\nCurbside pickup The state of delivery during the coronavirus has changed how things work. Following the lockdown and social distancing, new modes in last-mile delivery have appeared, like curbside pickup.\nWhat is Curbside Pickup?\n Curbside pickup is a delivery method where a customer buys an item online or over the phone, the store packages it and delivers it by placing it in the customer’s car or leaving it in front of the house (in front of the curb).\n With many countries in Europe already under some kind of mini-lockdown, including the United Kingdom, you should consider introducing curbside pickup to protect your customers and staff during Black Friday.\nClick \u0026amp; collect In case you plan to keep your physical stores open on Black Friday, you should consider adding click and collect to your offer.\nClick \u0026amp; Collect can remove some of the pressure from your delivery teams during the spike in order volumes while increasing sales and reducing the need for fulfilment.\nWhat is Click \u0026amp; Collect?\n Click and collect is a method of delivery where customers purchase an item online or over the phone and come to the physical store to collect their purchase over the counter.\n If you decide to keep physical locations closed, having this option available might entice local customers to take advantage of your online bargain deals and collect them when you re-open.\n***\nBiggest challenges in delivery logistics for Black Friday 2020 Fulfilling large order volumes and managing delivery logistics is tough in normal circumstances. What\u0026rsquo;s more, it\u0026rsquo;s twice as hard during the holiday season (and in a typical year).\nBut 2020 is fraught with concerns and obstacles, and that makes last-mile delivery a hopelessly difficult task this year. It\u0026rsquo;s almost a bridge too far to cross.\nBut cross it, you must. And to get a better sense of what lies ahead, take a look at these seven challenges in delivery logistics and how you can overcome them:\n1. Too few employees to handle higher workloads Typically, Black Friday is the start of the peak sales season. Usually, this means higher order volumes and more work for your staff.\nIn situations when stress levels are through the roof and productivity has to be 100%, it’s easy to get short-handed in one area of the last mile and remain idle in another.\nThe solution: Cross-train your staff. Cross-training allows you to prepare employees and teams to fill essential roles, so no area of operations is lagging.\nBusinesses tend to cross-train their workforce all year round, but there is still time left on the clock to do it until 27 November.\nAnd if you plan to keep your physical storefronts closed on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to start training and regrouping your salesforce first.\n2. Lack of communication with staff and customers How do your teams communicate with each other?\nDo planners and dispatchers talk to drivers? Or can they speak to other teams, as well? And how easy is it for drivers to talk to others after setting off on their delivery routes?\nCan all your delivery managers order new supplies? Or do you have a dedicated person who works only with suppliers?\nAnd what about your customers? Do you even communicate with them after following an order confirmation?\nLack of communication is among the top reasons why some of the biggest mistakes in delivery management and planning occur.\nAnd when you can\u0026rsquo;t speak well with customers or staff :\n supply chains fail to replenish inventory; orders get misplaced; operators dispatch drivers to wrong locations; deliveries don\u0026rsquo;t reach your customers; order accuracy rate crumbles, and; you lose money.  If you’re like most of our clients, you probably use several different channels to communicate with staff, as well as customers.\nThat can include everything from calls, emails, and text messages, to a variety of devices (like phones and telematics), systems (like dispatch and two-way radios), or specialized apps (like task managers and work chats).\nThe problem with all these channels is that most of them are disconnected from one another.\nAt the same time, the need for consistent communication between teams means that they have to check them constantly. That can cut productivity in half.\nAnd that’s without counting the conversations that they have to have with your customers.\nAnd with high order volumes, the lack of productivity due to poor communication is a serious problem you have to address before Black Friday.\nAs it turns out, the question of streamlining communication quickly becomes a question of whether to centralize or not to centralize delivery.\nThe solution: Open a centralized channel of communication Besides its many features and capabilities, last-mile delivery software functions as a centralized system of communication.\nThe software has two main components: a dashboard and a delivery app.\nThe dashboard provides task-to-task visibility for static teams. The driver app is an access point for your mobile workforce to communicate with staff and customers.\nThat limits the need for direct communication (over the phone or via text). At the same time, it provides all of the necessary information when handling day-to-day operations.\nThe software also works in real-time. Your teams can access the whereabouts of every delivery throughout its lifecycle.\nThat means you can send tracking links to customers, keeping them in the loop about their orders.\nStreamlining communication using last-mile delivery software is the first step in building an agile delivery operation. (A keystone step to dominate delivery on Black Friday)\n3. Maintaining suitable inventory levels With so many orders during the holiday shopping season, it’s easy to slip up and have too many or not enough inventory. In both cases, the wrong amount of stock can gut your revenue.\nThe solution: Demand forecast and cross-docking Take this time before Black Friday to forecast demand based on historical data analysis.\nAudit the numbers from previous years. Check how many supply orders you’ve made in each year, and compare it to your sales. That gives you an average estimate of your inventory needs.\nKeep in mind that this year’s numbers won’t be so close like in previous years. So use stock and sales numbers from 2020 (Q1 and Q2) for a more accurate forecast.\nTo reduce the risk, even more, speak to your suppliers. Work together to create a return deal, if you think that you won’t sell goods fast enough to make quick returns.\nAt the same time, prepare your inventory teams for cross-docking before Black Friday.\nCross-docking allows you to route goods from the supplier to your storage (or store), or between your multiple depot locations.\nThat makes it easier to quickly stock up or down depot sites according to the demand of last-mile delivery while keeping inventory carrying costs low.\n4. Scheduling pick-ups and drop-offs Scheduling pick-ups and drop-offs is hard under normal circumstances:\nYou have to ensure that drivers collect and complete orders at the right time so you don’t create a bottleneck at a depot site or miss any delivery windows.\nYou also have to ensure there is enough time to attend to each customer and add contingency time in case something unexpected does happen.\nBut with all the precautions you have to take due to COVID-19, not to mention the Black Friday level order volumes, this is almost a herculean undertaking.\nThe solution: Increase visibility over last-mile operations. Better schedules help you provide a better service to your customers. To do that and maintain a high fulfilment rate necessary for Black Friday, you need greater visibility over last-mile delivery.\nTechnically, visibility equals control. Control over your drivers. Control over your inventory. And control over your delivery schedules.\nDelivery management software can raise visibility over the last-mile. It allows you to integrate all the moving parts in your operation and manage them from one central hub.\nAnd since the software can integrate with other digital solutions (including order management and inventory management systems), you can use one tool to track, monitor, and organize the entire process from start to finish.\nAt the same time, the system is live. It uses geo-targeting to keep activities up to date, which gives you real-time visibility, as well.\nSo, even if you experience a hiccup during the Black Friday rush, you find and solve it immediately before it disrupts your well-planned schedule.\n5. Efficiently routing delivery drivers Routing delivery vehicles isn’t only about getting them from point A to point B.\nWhat many retailers fail to see is how better routing of their delivery fleet can raise key metrics in delivery logistics.\nIn doing so, you can inadvertently raise efficiency and reduce the cost of fulfilment at the same time.\nThe solution: Optimize your routes. Route optimization is a method of planning, managing, and mapping multiple routes based on critical factors.\n (Keep in mind that there is a difference between route planning and route optimization)\n If you’ve ever mapped multiple routes with multiple stops, then you know that finding the best one isn’t always about distance. Sometimes you have to analyze other parameters like:\n Types of roads Traffic patterns Pick-up locations Driver schedules Vehicle types Delivery windows And more.  All of this makes planning manually routes difficult. That’s why we suggest route optimization software.\nIt’s a way to automatically plan multiple routes with multiple stops and factors for all drivers in minutes.\nAnd when delivery orders start piling up, having a system that saves time can make it easier to streamline operations.\n6. Keeping staff and customers safe during drop-off We’ve already mentioned several times that Black Friday 2020 will be different. And it will.\nThanks to COVID-19, health and safety are now at the forefront of employee and customer concerns. And it’s up to you to keep them safe.\nThe solution: Follow the recommended guidelines. If you want to harness all the opportunities behind this sales season, you have to stick to these guidelines:\n Follow the updates from the World Health Organization Follow your countries’ health and safety regulations Follow any legal documents that you need to operate under a lockdown Comply with social distancing and keep crowds at a minimum Issue safety masks and hand disinfectant to all employees Respect all of the measures and hold others accountable to do the same  If you want to protect your employees and customers, even more, consider adding curbside pickup and click \u0026amp; collect as part of your offer.\n7. Handling return deliveries while fulfilling large order volumes Returns can happen at any moment.\nIt’s especially common during the holidays since most purchases are gifts. And people tend to return gifts that they don’t like.\nBut for you and other retailers, returns are a hassle. It is an arduous task during sales sprints, like Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\nIn situations when order volumes build-up by the minute, handling returns isn’t a top priority.\nBut a solid return policy is the keystone of a quality customer experience.\nIn fact, 96% of online shoppers say that the right return policy can influence their decisions to shop again with a retailer.\nSo you have to deal with customer returns as painlessly as possible.\nThe solution: Plan reverse logistics ahead of Black Friday. When eCommerce return costs go down, profits go up. But that requires you to focus on the main components of reverse logistics:\nSource: Cerasis.com\nTo make reverse logistics as painless as possible, create frictionless returns policy, set up a standard practice for handling returns, and automate ahead of Black Friday.\n Here’s an in-depth look at the relationship between reverse logistics and eCommerce returns.\n All of this, together with cross-docking and cross-training, will help you manage returns while maintaining a high fulfilment rate. (Despite working near the breaking point of your capacity)\nA chance to reinvent Black Friday From Black Friday and Cyber Monday to Christmas, it’s time to rethink holiday sales. And all you need for that to happen is a smart plan and the right tool to get the job done. (Like delivery management software)\nWith that at your disposal, you’ll have everything you need to overcome all of the trials and tribulations of this holiday season.\nThe challenges will be massive.

Next, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a deep dive into the benefits of free delivery. And whether the costs are worth it.\nFinally, we’ll show you all of the ways you can offer free delivery and how to make it part of your day-to-day delivery, step by step.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started.\nWhy should you offer free delivery? Should you offer free delivery as part of your service?\nThere is no easy answer to this question.\nOn the one hand, it’s what people want. Your customers want free delivery.\nBesides the convenience of same-day delivery, it’s probably the most prominent delivery option that customers crave.\nAnd study after study supports this claim, including vital delivery statistics:\n 95% of consumers prefer free one-day delivery as their most preferred method of receiving orders; 79.8% of consumers shop at Amazon because of Amazon’s free delivery and free same-day delivery; 48% of customers add more items to their shopping carts if it means receiving free delivery; 61% of consumers are likely to abandon their shopping cart if there is no free delivery on offer.  What all of these numbers tell you is that free delivery is embedded in consumer psychology.\nFor your customers, it’s a question of who pays for free shipping and why.\nThey don’t want to pay for the delivery because for them it’s a means to an end.\nIn their mind, they are not paying you for the delivery, but the products or services that they receive.\nBut shoppers place a lot of value on fast and reliable delivery, as well. So, the hatred that they feel when they have to pay for delivery is irrational.\nIn behavioural economics, this is known as the pain of paying.\nIt’s what helps us keep spending in check and affects our purchase decisions. And it all ties back to free delivery.\nIn an interview for The Atlantic, Ravi Dhar, the director of Yale’s Center for Customer Insights, highlights this irrationality with a simple explanation:\n “A 20 percent discount, which would add up to the same $5 or $8 that shipping costs—that’s not as effective as giving free shipping.”\n That’s because customers are more likely to pay a higher price for a product if it doesn’t have a separate delivery fee.\nBut that doesn’t mean it’s any easier to offer free shipping or delivery.\nAnd we return to the question of whether you should offer free delivery or not in the first place.\nIn fact, the answer is a simple one. Free delivery doesn’t work for every business. Particularly when your company covers all of the costs of handling deliveries.\nTechnically, not even Amazon fulfilment can rival its costs.\nSo, it regularly loses money on fulfilment:\nBut Amazon can handle it because of the immense profit that comes in from other different sources.\nAnd if you really want to know how to compete with Amazon delivery (and other giants), you need to co-exist with them.\nAnd the only way to do that is to offer free delivery deals.\nLuckily, an all-encompassing free delivery isn’t the only option.\nAnd there are many other ways you can create an offer that (seemingly) doesn’t charge your customers for delivery.\nBut before that, let’s take a look at the advantages of offering free delivery to your customers.\nThe benefits of free delivery. Free delivery is an obvious benefit to your customers.\nIn fact, nine out of ten consumers say it’s their number one incentive to shop online.\nBut what about sellers?\nHow does your store benefit from free delivery?\nThere are both short-term and long-term gains from adding free delivery and how it pays off to your delivery.\nShort-term benefits of free delivery Boosting sales. In the short-term, the greatest benefit of offering free delivery is a boost in sales.\nIf shoppers already like to buy your products, free delivery for existing customers will only entice more of them to return for another purchase.\nIn turn, that leads to greater order volumes and more profit.\nAttracting new customers At the same time, free delivery is a great incentive for new customers.\nIt can entice new leads or leads are already in your sales pipeline to convert into actual customers.\nRaising brand awareness The marketing potential of adding free delivery can also be a big boost to your business.\nStores that have free shipping can generally raise brand awareness.\nThink Grubhub, Doordash, Uber Eats, Dominos, and Postmates.\nAll of those brands are now synonymous with free home and food delivery.\nAnd all of them have profited in 2020 thanks to the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus.\nBut an initial spike in sales doesn’t justify the need to offer free shipping.\nSo, you need to look beyond the baseline period.\nOnce you add free home delivery you can’t turn it off. That’s why you have to look at the long-term gains, as well.\nLong-term benefits of free delivery Amplifying lifetime value The main long-term benefit of free delivery is that it elevates the lifetime value of your current pool of customers.\nThat’s one of the key arguments Kevin Kelly makes when discussing 1,000 true fans.\nAdding free delivery adds value to your audience by removing their pain points and elevating their shopping experience to a higher level.\nCustomers are happier to return to your point of sale and purchase more products, simply because you have raised their overall satisfaction with your service.\nSimply put, free delivery turns your one-time customers into recurring regulars that shop more and spend more money than other consumers.\nStaying competitive in the market Adding free shipping on orders gives you an edge over competitors because it makes your offer more appealing to customers.\nThink of it like this: What product will your customer choose?\nThe one that you deliver for free to his home?\nOr the one from a store that charges £8 for delivery?\nHowever, you are not alone.\nAnd these days, many companies offer free delivery.\nSo, it\u0026rsquo;s no longer just a question of gaining a competitive advantage, it\u0026rsquo;s also about staying relevant in the current landscape.\nFree delivery expands business Adding value to the customers makes them more approachable and trusting to your other offers.\nThat makes it easier to adopt delivery tactics to grow your operations.\nCustomers that have a relationship with your company are more likely to accept your other offers.\nFor example, when upselling or cross-selling with delivery.\nAll the while converting others to do the same and buying and ordering more products.\nFocusing on short-term and long-term benefits makes it easier to warrant the need for free delivery.\nEven though all of these advantages raise profit margins, you still need to keep a close eye on costs.\nHow much does free delivery cost? Despite its name, free delivery isn’t really free.\nIt comes at a considerable cost to you, your company, or your customers.\nAnd despite its many benefits, free shipping expenses can eat away at your profits if you’re not careful.\nIt’s worth taking a second to look at how much will free delivery cost you and the toll it will take on your bottom line.\nHere are five costs you need to keep an eye on:\n1. Delivery operations Operational expenses are a huge cost when offering free delivery.\nSo the first thing you need to do is to calculate how much it costs to deliver a product to a customer.\nThe first step is to determine whether it’s better to use an internal vs external fleet (i.e. outsourcing to a third-party logistics (3PL) provider like UPS or DHL).\nWith an in-house fleet, you cover all the costs of delivery yourself. That includes:\n capital expenses (Capex) like onboarding, purchasing vehicles and equipment, setting up depot locations and creating a supply chain network, and; operating expenses (Opex) like overhead costs (rent and insurance) and variable costs (payroll, fuel consumption, and vehicle maintenance and repairs).  When you outsource to an outside 3PL company, a service fee covers all of these costs.\nCompanies usually charge their services per delivery, size, weight, volume, distance travelled, or as a flat monthly charge.\nOnce you decide what to do, observe key metrics in delivery logistics.\nMeasuring KPIs will give you a much clearer picture of your operational expenses.\nFor example, calculating the average cost per delivery allows you to find out what it costs to deliver a single item.\nFrom there, you can use this information to determine the price of your products and choose the best approach to offer free delivery. (More on that later)\nRight now, you need to look at how these costs affect your profit margins.\n2. Profit margins Profit margins from sales with free delivery are closely related to the cost of delivery.\nSo to make it work, you need to determine how much products you have to sell and at what price.\nCompare these numbers to the operational expenses.\nAnd see whether you can cover the costs of free delivery.\nIf you see that you will lose money on free delivery, you will have to do something about it.\nThat means raising the amount of profit you generate, reducing the cost of operations, or both.\n3. Development A strategic approach to free delivery is going to consume a lot of resources, as well.\nSetting up the necessary infrastructure (both digital and physical) requires time, effort, and money.\nFrom a digital standpoint, your IT team will have to add free delivery to all online sales channels (web store, social media, online marketplaces).\nAnd that will require a lot of programming and testing before rolling it out.\nFrom a physical perspective, operations managers will have to audit current capabilities and ensure you have all of the equipment, vehicles, and staff to support free delivery (even when demand exceeds capacity).\nNot to mention, it\u0026rsquo;s worth reviewing your supply chain, depot sites, and inventory to make sure the process is ready before launch.\n4. Marketing In marketing terms, offering free delivery has tons of promotional value.\nTo make the most of it, you will need to invest heavily in advertising to generate awareness and reach as many people as possible with your new offer.\n5. Unnecessary incentive Finally, you have to consider losses from customers who would have bought a product from you without the incentive of free shipping.\nBut determining whether free delivery is an unnecessary incentive is difficult.\nThe best way to find this out is to take a look at your current customer base and total sales profit.\nIf you are satisfied with order volumes and the amount of profit you generate, maybe it’s worth postponing a free shipping incentive until a later date or offering other less costly incentives like discounts instead.\nHow to offer free delivery? Free delivery is a complicated matter.\nThere is no one-size-fits-all approach to the process.\nAnd there is even less room to manoeuvre than any other type of delivery.\nTechnically, nothing is free.\nSomebody is going to lose money here.\nBe it you or your customers someone will always have to get the short end of the stick and carry the burden of free delivery.\nBut there are ways you can offer free delivery to customers without losing too much money, or losing too many customers in the process.\nAll you have to do is be smart about it, and choose the best free delivery option for your business.\nThat said, there are more ways than one for sellers to offer free delivery.\nHere are the most common ways to do it:\n1. Free standard delivery on all orders. Companies include free delivery with every purchase, regardless of the order value, products in question, or the number of ordered items.\nStores that sell small, lighter products have no problem offering sitewide free delivery.\nFor example, it is much easier to offer free delivery with flowers than to offer free furniture delivery.\nOthers businesses might offer free standard delivery with a fine print that limits free delivery based on method or location.\nFor example, many US companies offer ground free delivery to customers living in the contiguous United States, excluding the states of Hawaii and Alaska.\nHowever, companies like Zappos offer free delivery and returns on all orders with no minimums or exclusions.\nThe company can afford to offer widespread free delivery after it was acquired by Amazon. But that’s not the only offer available to you.\n2. Free delivery with a minimum threshold. Creating a minimum purchase threshold is a more cost-effective way of offering free delivery or shipping.\nSetting a minimum order value encourages your customers to buy more products and qualify for free delivery.\nThis raises the profit margin for every order, reducing the financial risk associated with free delivery. Here’s an example from Target:\nSource: Target\nBut before you adopt this offer, you need to determine your free shipping threshold.\nHow to calculate the free shipping threshold? To do that, you need to find the difference between the proposed minimum cart value and your average order value.\nAfter that, you need to multiply it by the gross profit margin and subtract the average cost of delivery from the result.\nHere is an example of calculating the free shipping minimum when the proposed minimum cart value is set at $50 and $60:\nSource: UPS Deliveries\n3. Free delivery on particular items. It’s a common practice among retail stores to offer free delivery only on certain products.\nUsually, these are products with a profit margin that can bear the cost of free delivery.\nFor example, some stores use free delivery to incentivize customers to buy luxury goods or products that are not selling well.\nSource: Shoes for Crews\nOther stores will use it to sell large items that would otherwise require additional effort from the customer, such as appliance or furniture free delivery.\nHowever, there is a point to be made about adding free delivery to lower-margin products, as well.\nTechnically, this makes it easier to communicate the free shipping offer to your customers.\nSource: Bernie \u0026amp; Phyl\u0026rsquo;s\nPlus it motivates customers to buy those items in larger quantities, especially popular products which have a well-established supply chain.\n4. Free delivery at certain times. Adding a timestamp to your offer is another alternative to widespread free delivery.\nInstead of an all-year-round standard service, you set up periodical offers on certain days, dates, periods, or times of the year.\nFor example, a lot of companies offer free shipping during the holiday season. It’s a good idea to add free delivery at this time because it makes you more competitive.\nAnd consumers have also come to expect these kinds of incentives during the holidays.\nYou may have noticed this during Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales:\nSource: Aston Villa Football Club\nSource: Ikea Canada\n Here\u0026rsquo;s a complete guide to crushing last-mile delivery logistics on Black Friday.\n Besides the holidays, some retailers create free shipping days and add it to the regular monthly or weekly offer, as the case with Enderly Coffee’s free home delivery on Fridays:\nSome extend the offer beyond 24 hours, and offer free delivery over an entire weekend or week:\nSource: Amazon UK\n5. Free delivery to specific locations. Likewise, many companies choose to deliver products for free only to specific locations (like the contiguous United States example).\nBut some take it a step further.\nMany small and medium businesses add free local delivery (3-5 kilometres).\nAlthough this is usually associated with food delivery (takeaways or restaurants that offer fast and free delivery), retailers do it, as well.\nIt’s simply much closer to their supply chains:\nSource: The Curve Cult\n6. Free delivery with click and collect. Click \u0026amp; Collect is one of the new delivery management trends.\nRather than delivering an order directly to customers, you deliver it to a store nearest to their location.\nOnce the order is at the physical store, customers can come to pick-up it up.\nThis usually works if you’re a large retailer with multiple stores or depots at multiple different sites.\nBut even if you have one physical point of sale, you can offer free delivery today if you add click and collect like Gant from Australia:\n7. Free delivery with membership. Ever since free delivery with Amazon Prime membership was introduced, this method of offering free delivery with membership became popular among retailers.\nSource: Amazon Australia\nA company charges an annual fee to customers, and in return shoppers receive access to free shipping on all orders, as well as other perks that would otherwise be unavailable to them.\n8. Free delivery with loyalty programs. Retailers use loyalty programs to incentivize shoppers with free delivery to do repeat business.\nBy doing so, you can generate greater long-term returns from free delivery over time and raise the lifetime value of each customer.\nFor example, Grubhub, Uber Eats, Doordash, and Postmates all offer promo codes (or coupons) that allow returning customers to qualify for free delivery:\nSource: Uber Eats\nWhile other companies, provide customers with a chance to qualify for next free delivery after the initial purchase:\nSource: Bottlemart\n9. Adding delivery as part of the product price. Baking the cost of delivery into the price of your product isn’t actually free delivery.\nBut many retailers raise product prices for the cost of shipping, which makes it seem to some customers that they offer free delivery.\nAt best this is a gamble.\nFirst, if the price of your products is too high, you risk chasing away customers even though they might have to pay for shipping with your competitors.\nOn the other hand, if your customers catch on to what you are doing, again you risk chasing them off because they will lose trust with you.\nHowever, the chance to promote a free delivery offer can significantly raise traffic to your store.\nAnd with more traffic, the short-term gains more than make up for the risks of charging shoppers for delivery without their knowledge.\n10. Free delivery on returns. Finally, you might not want to consider adding free shipping only on returns.\nEven though there is a fine balance between reverse logistics and eCommerce returns.\nMany apparel stores, for example, use free returns to entice customers to buy more products.\nCustomers would go online, pick five items, purchase them, and after trying them out, use free delivery to return the clothes that they don’t want.\nFree returns raise the lifetime value of your customers, as well.\nIn fact, 96% of online shoppers say that a good return policy motivates them to do business again.\nThat’s why 77% of all returns come from repeat customers.\nHow to make free delivery part of your operations? As mentioned, free delivery isn’t free.\nAnd one of the biggest reasons why it isn’t free is that someone has to cover the cost of delivery logistics.\nAt the same time, you have to build an agile delivery operation that can handle free deliveries without putting other, more cost-effective delivery options at stake.\nThe solution is to know how to manage delivery operations once you include free delivery to your offer.\nNot only will it allow you to make free shipping part of your business, but it will also make it much more affordable to do it in the first place.\nHere are a few ways you can go about it:\n1. Reduce the rate of fulfilment. Free delivery doesn’t necessarily mean fast delivery.\nInstead of planning it as standard 2-day delivery, why not extend the delivery window?\nIf your customers don’t want to pay for a delivery, they won’t mind waiting a few extra days to receive it.\nAfter all, that’s why many of them are willing to pay for faster alternatives, such as same-day delivery.\nIn fact, 88% of consumers are willing to pay for faster delivery.\nIt stands to reason that moving the deadline from two to five days won’t affect customer experience.\nIt gives you more time to consolidate resources and order volumes, and add free deliveries only when it makes sense.\nFor instance, when a driver is passing through that location between two regular deliveries.\n2. Plan ahead. A sure-fire way to make free deliveries less taxing on your day-to-day operations is to plan them ahead of time.\nFor example, you can allocate one day of the week to complete all of them.\nIf you decide to deliver all orders marked with free shipping on Fridays, your delivery managers have until Thursday to map routes with multiple stops and significantly decrease your cost per delivery.\nAnd since you only offer to deliver an order for free within five business days, you will always make good on your promise.\n3. Focus on the local delivery area. The closer your customers are to your supply chain, the less it costs to deliver your products to them.\nSo, if you don’t want to risk too many costs, start small and deliver products for free only to the local last mile.\n4. Increase route density. Are you still planning manually?\nIf you are, you better consider automating the process and use route optimisation software instead.\nWith delivery management software and the ability to plan ahead, you can raise route density on all your routes.\nSimply put, when you raise the number of stops on each route, the cost per delivery goes drastically down.\nAnd that’s what can make it more affordable to add free delivery as part of your offer.\nOn the other hand, you can treat free deliveries the same as any other delivery and plan routes automatically and in real-time.\nYou can add them as tasks to driver schedules to raise the route density on all orders and, thus, decrease cost per delivery across the board.\n5. Optimize your entire delivery. If you truly want to minimise the risks and costs associated with free delivery, it’s vital to optimise your entire delivery operations.\nTaking a platform approach to delivery management can get you there.\nA delivery management platform is an end-to-end delivery solution.\nIt gives you control over the entire life cycle for each order because it can integrate with any other system you use.\nYou can automate and increase the efficiency of every part of that process.\nTechnically, a solution like eLogii can help you:\n Keep records of all deliveries and customers in one place; Instant and full access to data relevant for delivery planning; Automatically assign tasks to the nearest driver or delivery agent; Reduce the learning curve and training time thanks to an intuitive interface; Organise, coordinate and communicate with drivers and field agents remotely; Track and monitor drivers and agents in the field in real-time; Provide delivery tracking links to customers; Collect feedback and service ratings from customers; Collect reports and electronic proof of delivery from drivers; Send SMS and email notifications to customers about the delivery status and ETAs; Analyse performance data to optimise operations and make data-driven decisions.

You’ll see:\n What drives online returns in the first place; The current eCommerce returns best practices; And how to cut the cost of returns with reverse logistics.  At the same time, you’ll get an in-depth look at what reverse logistics process steps you need to take to make it better and work for you.\nLet’s start.\nWhy do your customers return products? There is no one answer to this question.\nTechnically, customers return products for a number of reasons.\nSome customers return products because they arrive damaged.\nOthers don’t fit or don’t match expectations.\nWhile others still are gifts that people want to return.\nWhatever the case, there are a lot of people looking to return their purchases.\nIn fact, 89% of consumers have returned an item that they have bought online in the last three years.\nWhile 42% have returned a purchased item in the last six months.\nHere are the leading causes of product returns:\nThe top reasons for returns in eCommerce:\n The received item not as described: 23% The description doesn’t match the item: 22% The item was damaged or defective: 20% Other reasons or not mentioned: 35%  But consumer-preference is a big factor, as well.\nWhen it comes to clothing and fashion, the reasons behind returns are different.\nA survey by Return Magic of 1,000 businesses and over 800,000 Shopify customers revealed how consumer-preference is the reason behind 72% of all returns.\nHere, defective and not as described products (non-preference reasons) accounted for only 10% of returns.\nThe top reasons for returns (fashion and clothing):\n The size was too small: 30% The size was too large: 22% Changed my mind: 12% The style was wrong: 8% Not as described: 5% Damaged/defective: 5% Other or not mentioned: 18%  But at the same time, some customers return products for no apparent reason.\nAt least 41% of customers say they actually purchase a product only to return it.\nHabitual returners like these fall into two categories:\n  People who buy a product only to wear it or use it once and then return it with no intention of keeping it.\nThey either don’t have enough money to buy the item or exploit lax return policies.\n  People who recreate the brick-and-mortar store shopping experience at home by buying the same items in multiple different sizes, versions, or colours.\nOnce the items arrive, they try out all of them, pick the best one, and return the rest.\n  The growing trend of sampling products before buying them is the direct result of eCommerce.\nTo accommodate the demand, retailers and brands have introduced the try-before-you-buy option in recent years.\nAnd it just one of eCommerce returns best practices to consider.\nWhat are the best eCommerce return policies? Returns are a key part of the online shopping experience.\nThat’s why it’s critical to transparently illustrate the return policy to your customers just as you would label a feature on a product.\nAccording to UPS, 88% of consumers check the return policy when shopping online.\nWhile 67% of them review the return policy before completing the purchase.\nIf the return policy is not transparent, unclear, or inadequate, 15% of potential customers will abandon their shopping cart.\nSo a return policy also has to be generous in the eyes of your customers.\nIn fact, 96% of online shoppers say that good return policies influence their decisions to do business again with an e-retailer.\nAnd because of that, consumer-friendly return policies can drive sales and profit.\nHere are some examples of best practices and solid eCommerce returns solutions you can use when it comes to your return policy:\nFree returns Offering a free return with every purchase is by far the most generous policy you can have.\nIn fact, free returns or exchanges are the number two reason that would make consumers “more likely to shop online.”\nAnd according to Dotcom Distribution, 90% of consumers “highly value” free returns, while 62% of them “would buy again” from a brand offering free returns or exchanges on their products.\nZappos (an Amazon company) is the best eCommerce returns example of this practice.\nThe company offers free shipping and returns on all their shoes, to all of their customers, all year round.\nTalking to Fast Company, Zappos’ Vice President of service and operations, Craig Adkins said:\n “Our best customers have the highest return rates, but they are also the ones that spend the most money with us and are our most profitable customers.”\n But without the acquisition of Amazon, the company would struggle to afford such a policy.\nThis, however, hasn’t stopped others to promote the same business model.\nThe danger in offering free returns is that you ignore how returns relate to profit, especially for small-to-medium businesses.\nWhen you take a look at large brands, the cost of returns is just 2% as a percentage of revenue.\nFor SMBs, the cost of returns is closer to 48%.\nIn other words, if you want to offer free returns, you have to accept the cost of doing business (managing reverse logistics) and take a more bottom-line driven approach to reduce costs and maintain a profit.\n(More on that later)\nBut if you can manage that efficiently, research suggests that free returns could raise spending by 158%-457% when compared to pre-return spending.\nWhile another study from the University of Texas at Dallas revealed that:\n “a lenient return policy with a longer return window can result in more returns but correlate with an increase in purchase volume.”\n Try-before-you-buy Customers love convenience.\nA survey by PwC shows how it’s one of the key factors that drive customers to choose a brand in the first place.\nSimilar principles apply to same-day delivery.\nOnly here, customers want the convenience of shopping online with the experience of going to a physical store.\nIn other words: Your customers want to get a chance to try something out before they buy.\nAnd as mentioned, this is the direct result of eCommerce and habitual returners.\nIn 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon had started banning customers who “made too many returns”.\nThis prompted Amazon to reveal Prime Wardrobe.\nPrime members in the US can order 3-8 items with a 7-day window to return them before paying for the order.\nOthers use returns-management apps.\nAs Kaleigh Moore from Glossy explains, companies use these apps to allow:\n “shoppers to buy again using a credit before shipping an item back.”\n Now, it’s a common practice.\nOnline retailers like Walmart, Aldo, Sephora, Home Depot, Warby Parker, and other stores offer free online returns, which enables customers to try on products at no cost upfront.\nA frictionless return policy Consumers are returning products now more than ever.\nSo much in fact, that most eCommerce retailers see return rates hold out at around 20% throughout the year, and spike to 30% during the holiday season.\nAnd the trend will only continue.\nThanks to free online returns and try-before-you-buy policies, retailers in the US and UK have experienced a 40% rise in returns.\nThe good news is that 77% of all those returns come from repeat customers.\nAnd that’s a real opportunity for you to increase sales, as long as you make the process as simple as possible.\nTo do that, you need to create a frictionless return policy.\nFrictionless returns elevate the customer experience and increase satisfaction.\nAnd with 67% of millennials abandoning shopping carts if they feel the return process is complicated, the return policy can make or break a sale.\nSo, how do you make returns painless for customers?\nYou listen to your customers.\nOne thing that’s true for all of your customers is that they are all different.\nAnd they all want a choice when deciding how to return a purchase.\nSo, you need to provide as many distinct return options available to them.\nFor example, while most customers prefer home pick-up as a method of returning an online purchase, there are at least 16% of online shoppers who returned an item by dropping it off at the store.\nPeople like Lisa Fields from New Jersey (USA). After facing an “online returns only” policy, Lisa abandoned her purchase and said in an interview:\n “My kids are finicky. If I can’t return clothing to a store, I won’t buy it.”\n How people want to return an online purchase:\n Post office Carrier Collection point Locker Home pick-up Retail Store  At the same time, it’s worth giving customers different refund options to choose from, and offer cashback, product exchange, or in-store credit.\nBut whatever return options you end up including in your policy has to be easy for customers to return an item, and for you to enforce it.\nOtherwise, you risk losing customers or piling up costs due to ineffective returns management.\nHow much does poor returns management cost your company? The simple answer is A LOT!\nIn fact, the cost of return deliveries worldwide will reach $642 billion this year.\nAnd, for example, the cost of running Amazon’s reverse logistics is $16.2 billion alone.\nOf course, the cost of your returns won’t reach those levels.\nBut you still lose money because:\n You have to refund the customer for their purchase (cashback, product exchange, or in-store credit) You have to cover the cost of the initial delivery, the pick of the return, and the delivery of the replacement product You have to recondition the returned product for resale (repackage the item or send it back to the supplier for a replacement) You have to invest additional resources on sorting out returns, finding a replacement, and reshipping the return  Each return comes as a cost to your company. And every cost is a hit to your bottom line.\nTechnically, the return process can amount to 10% of the total supply chain costs for an average business.\nBut if the return process is poorly managed and inefficient, expenditure can skyrocket and cut profit by 30% (or more).\nOn top of that, an inaptly enforced eCommerce return policy harms the customers’ experience and discourages them from doing repeat business.\nThat can eat away at your revenue much more than the cost of your returns.\nTo deal with this, you must look at ways to decrease the cost of your returns.\nHow to reduce the cost of eCommerce returns? Returns are the natural part of the shopping experience.\nWhether it’s a brick-and-mortar store or eCommerce retail, getting rid of them is out of the question.\nInstead, you must strive to make the process as painless as possible for your organization.\nWhat you have to understand is that returns are a trade-off between reducing the impact on your bottom line and encouraging customers to buy from you.\nWe have already touched on how free returns, try-before-you-buy, and a frictionless return policy can entice customers to convert to buyers.\nBut the very least you should do is to offer a 30-day window for free returns.\nA (now standard) 30-day free return policy ensures you don’t drive away customers at checkout in the first place.\nThe next thing you need to do is to take a bottom-line driven approach to how you manage returns.\nAnd to do that, you will need to follow these three steps:\nStep #1 Review and benchmark the current return process. Make sure that the instructions for your return policy are easy to follow and identical across all of your communication channels (website, social media, product pages, labels, etc.).\nThen, audit your returns.\nIdentify any gaps or bottlenecks in the process.\nYou can do this by taking a look at recurring queries from customers.\nCommon questions about returns include:\n Where is my refund? Where is my replacement item? When is my exchange item due? How long does it take to replace an item? How much does it cost to return an item? Who covers the cost of the return?  View these questions as opportunities to improve the way you manage returns.\nAt the same time, you have to take into account:\n How easy (or difficult) it is for customers to contact you about returns How do you approve returns (customer verification and return forms) How do you track returns once they have been approved and picked up How do you handle returns once they arrive or return to inventory How do you keep books in order and adjust inventory, sales, and taxes  A more holistic and transparent view of the entire return process will help you fix some of the biggest delivery challenges in eCommerce such as reverse logistics and how you enforce the return policy later on.\nStep #2 Collect and use data to organize the return rates. A product return rate analysis looks at return rates in relationship with net sales.\nIt lets you design customer return profiles from the least to the most profitable buyer.\nFor example, customers that have a high return rate aren’t necessarily unprofitable because they might buy a lot of products as a result of their returns.\nOn the other hand, it helps you to weed out habitual returners.\nThe data is also more accurate than the industry average.\nIt is easier to pinpoint opportunities to generate more profit based on information originating from inside your organization.\nAnd your efforts to optimize the return process are more in-line with your capabilities.\nThat can help you set up more realistic price limits (thresholds per order value) or return windows for your customers, as well.\nStep #3 Examine the price, value and return rate of your products. Returns work differently from other operations.\nIf you can increase the perceived value of a product, you can lower the return rate.\nThe only question is: how do you increase the value of your products?\nOne way is to play around with the price of a product.\nFor example, if you reduce the price tag on a product, customers will perceive the difference in price as value.\nThey will think that the money they save is more valuable than the hassle to return the product.\nThe same applies when you increase the price.\nA customer may associate a higher price with a higher quality of the product, and therefore perceive it as more valuable.\nAnd whenever customers put a value on a product (or service), it’s much more difficult to detach themselves from the item and return it.\nWhen that happens, profit goes up because return rates drop considerably.\n***\nBut these three steps are just the start. To truly lift your bottom line, you need the right backend that can give you the edge to deal with the cost of eCommerce returns.\nHow to handle online returns with reverse logistics? On the one hand, we’ve mentioned how important it is to keep customers happy with your return policy.\nOn the other, it’s just as important to dedicate enough attention to satisfy your corporate needs.\nIn eCommerce, reverse logistics have to satisfy both sides of your business: the customer and the company.\nOften, when businesses consider reverse logistics for the first time, they overlook one in favour of the other.\nUsually, companies put the needs of customers ahead of their company.\nBut what many fail to realize is that there are suitable opportunities to raise profit margins by optimizing the reverse logistics process.\nIn doing so, you reduce the cost of operations, and the impact returns have on your bottom line.\nAt the same time, you improve performance and efficiency, which raises customer satisfaction.\nBefore you start optimizing, it’s vital to know what is reverse logistics and what is it used for.\nNot to mention, the key components that make up eCommerce reverse logistics.\nIn simple terms reverse logistics is:\n “\u0026hellip;the process that controls the return movement of orders from their final destination\u0026hellip; [which] covers a company’s return policy.”\n  Find out how reverse logistics can turn failure into opportunity\n In the diagram below, you can see the key components of eCommerce reverse logistics.\nIt is necessary to improve the efficiency of each process if you want to successfully keep up with online returns.\nSource: Cerasis.com\nBut a majority of eCommerce retailers aren’t equipped to effectively deal with online returns, most notably when demand exceeds capacity.\nStill, many more also lack the experience to keep up with that growing demand.\nResearch suggests that 44% of retailers complain about how handling and packaging returns had hurt their margins.\nAnd this is a huge problem for online business owners.\nIf your supply chain is unable to handle the influx of return goods, the products will be stored indefinitely and raise waste, as well as cost.\nA different UPS report explains that without a robust reverse logistics process, a business could lose over 50% of returned inventory value if you fail to sell the products in secondary markets.\nAgain, that’s why you need to make return logistics as painless as possible.\nThe first step is to develop a standard practice for handling the eCommerce returns management process.\nFor small-to-medium eCommerce stores, this may seem easy.\nSometimes all you need is one team (or even one person) to focus on returns, and take care of logistics.\nBut the problem comes to light when you start growing, and you have to scale your operations quickly.\nIn these situations, it’s necessary to begin adopting strategies to optimize your reverse logistics, as well as proven delivery tactics to grow your operations.\nAnd one of the main strategies that make returns easier to handle is automation.\nStart automating the return process Automating any process is a daunting task.\nIt requires the right approach to integration and tools with a low learning curve, especially if you are still planning manually.\nAnd even then it takes some time to get used to it.\nBut in the modern eCommerce arena, digital transformation is a necessity if you want to unravel the maze of inbound and outbound logistics.\nThe good news is that businesses are already taking that leap forward.\nA Gartner survey shows that 70% of supply chain leaders plan to invest in the circular economy until 2022.\nHowever, only 12% have connected that strategy with their digital transformation.\nNevertheless, companies are using technology.\nMany of them in vital areas of their process, including:\n Delivery: 46% Customer engagement: 45% Manufacturing: 43% Planning: 43%  At the moment, a third of surveyed companies (27%) are using technology to improve reverse logistics, as well.\nAnd another 39% of respondents are planning to integrate a reverse logistics solution by 2022.\nSo, the time is right to start looking at eCommerce returns software.\nBut what apps and tools should you look for?\nTechnically, there are two options available for you to explore.\n(When you don’t want to turn the reverse logistics process over to a 3PL company)\nReturns Management Systems The first option includes apps that specialize primarily in reverse logistics.\nThese apps include solutions like:\n Returnly Loop Return Magic Happy Returns  The benefits of returns-management systems are that you take a narrow-front approach to reverse logistics.\nOne tool for one task.\nAll of these apps specialize in returns efficiency.\nAnd all of them can integrate with any:\n Inventory management system (IMS); Order-management system (OMS), or; Warehouse management systems (WMS) (for international operations).  But providers like Happy Returns, take reverse logistics a step further.\nThis company offers both a physical service to go along with its SaaS solution.\nHappy Returns provides its customers with over 700 physical locations (in the US) where online shoppers can return products in person.\nThe downside of returns-management systems is that they focus on one area of the ecosystem.\nNot taking an omnichannel approach is fine when you only have to deal with inbound logistics.\nBut if you want a platform that can tackle forward as well as reverse logistics for the entire fulfilment process, you need to take a different approach.\nAnd that brings us to the second option.\nDelivery management platforms Delivery management software takes a holistic approach to managing all aspects of delivery logistics and in every environment.\nCompanies as varied as beverage distributors and pharmacy deliveries use it for everything from route optimisation and ePOD to reverse logistics.\nSolutions like eLogii, also use smart APIs to integrate with all other tools you use.\nYou can connect this platform to any OMS, IMS or WMS, or any other system, including your website or Shopify account.\nWhat this brings to the table is complete visibility and total control over your entire operations across your entire supply chain.\nIt enables you to track and monitor every piece moving on your logistical chessboard, as well as to collect, evaluate and act on data in real-time.\nThat makes delivery management platforms ideal when you want to offer free returns inside a 30-day window to customers.\nFor example, when a customer contacts you about a return, the dashboard allows your teams to scan the map for a suitable driver.\nThey can then treat the returns just as a delivery order, and add a pick-up task to the driver’s delivery schedule, as well as a drop-off task at the depot site.\nBecause the software is adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics, all of the information you have just uploaded is automatically visible to everyone involved: the driver, customer support, depot or inventory teams, and returns managers.\nWhat’s more, you can increase customer satisfaction by offering to exchange products as soon as a return request arrives.\nSince the system connects to an IMS, you can scan multiple depot locations to find the replacement, notify the inventory manager, and send the nearest driver to pick it up.\nAt the other end, a different driver (closer to the customer) can pick up the return, and bring it in for repackaging or send it back to the supplier.\nUsing delivery management software to build an agile delivery operation like this will increase the performance and efficiency of both reverse and forward logistics.\nAnd that means:\n Less waste; Lower costs; A stable bottom line; More value to your customers, and; An efficient return policy.

And a big boost to your bottom line.\nSo, without any more delay, here’s how you can cut costs with delivery management software:\n1. Improve decision making and agility Speed is the key to managing a modern field service operation or delivery.\nBut as you grow, it becomes difficult to scale.\nMany struggle to maintain a fast service, and that’s when costs skyrocket.\nWhat many fail to understand is that operational speed is the direct result of fast and efficient decision making.\nIt’s what enables you to build an agile delivery operation and effectively react to the reality of day-to-day operations.\nAnd the only way to adopt this strategy is to deploy delivery management software.\nDelivery management software makes it possible to achieve an agile transformation of your organization.\nBy streamlining the decision-making process, this type of solution helps you to achieve all five dimensions of agility: alertness, accessibility, decisiveness, speed, and flexibility.\nAt the same time, an agile transformation touches every aspect of your operation, including structure, processes, people, and technology.\nThat’s why 37% of companies have already started this process, according to McKinsey.\nLeveraging delivery management software gives you access to a feature-rich environment that works in real-time.\nThis means that not only do you have complete visibility and control over the entire operation, but you can also make split-second decisions to make the best call depending on the situation.\nAnd when you can make rapid decisions to fix problems and modify activities, you maximize the speed and efficiency of the entire operation.\nAnd the greater the speed and efficiency, the more profit you make, and the less money you lose.\n2. Measure and analyze KPIs Taking steps to optimize operations isn’t an easy task.\nEven when you uncover a process where you are losing money, it doesn’t mean your efforts will bring about the desired results.\nIt’s necessary to monitor these activities and track their effects on the bottom line.\nThe secret is to measure key metrics in delivery logistics.\nCalculating key performance indicators (or KPIs) works in two ways.\nFirst, it helps you take a quantifiable approach to gauge the performance of your delivery and identify strengths and weaknesses in your operations.\nAt the same time, KPIs let you stay on top of optimization efforts once you put them into action.\nIn turn, the data can help you follow up on their progress, and see whether they are making an actual impact or if you need to take a different approach to get rid of operational waste.\nCalculating and analyzing KPIs is the main activity by which all others will measure up to.\nBut measuring KPIs is difficult. It’s virtually impossible to do it without the use of technology.\nSo, if you want to track key metrics in delivery logistics to measure for success, you need to include delivery management software into your system.\nDelivery management platforms are an end-to-end solution to delivery logistics.\nThis enables you to plan, manage, and operate all your tasks in one place.\nSince you use a single digital system to control everything, it can automatically store information about the performance of activities.\nAnd you can use delivery management software to track many different KPIs:\n Number of deliveries Average time per delivery The average cost per delivery On-time delivery Order accuracy Time in transit to distance Vehicle capacity vs. available capacity And more  Having access to these metrics allows you to review the current state of affairs and benchmark them against your efforts.\nOnce you can accurately monitor performance based on numbers and math, optimization is simple.\nAll you have to do is track, evaluate, optimize, test, and repeat.\nIn doing so, you will continually cut costs by constantly driving the efficiency of your operations forward.\n3. Reduce fuel consumption For many delivery and field services, fuel is a big concern.\nIn fact, fuel consumption can account for more than 30% of operating expenses (Opex) for most businesses that operate fleets.\nBut at the same time, controlling these costs isn’t easy.\nOn the one hand, the continuous rise of global oil prices means the price of fuel is only going to go up.\nOn the other, the dynamic nature of delivery means planning the fuel budget is nothing short of a complex variable.\nNonetheless, conserving fuel and keeping fuel costs down is a priority which many companies struggle with and lack the proper solution to handle.\nFor example, some companies are downsizing vehicles or converting them to more fuel-efficient models, like hybrids and NGVs (natural gas vehicles).\nOthers are buying up fuel in bulk when the price is right.\nWhile these tactics improve fuel efficiency, the resources required to implement them downplay any short-term savings that they generate.\nThe only way to truly reduce fuel costs is to use technology to reduce the number of miles driven per each delivery.\nDelivery management software helps with this.\nDue to its modular design, the system has all the necessary route planning and route optimization capabilities to improve fuel consumption at all levels of your operation.\nBut choosing the best routes doesn’t mean simply calculating the shortest route (in terms of distance).\nTo truly cut fuel costs, you also need to map routes with multiple stops and reduce delays en route to the destination.\nThat’s why route optimization takes into account key factors such as drivers, vehicles, traffic patterns, types of roads or junctions, and delivery windows to calculate the best route based on all available assets.\nSo with better routes, you can reduce:\n Distance to destination Time to destination Number of miles driven Out-of-route mileage Fuel consumption per route Fuel consumption per driver  At the same time, the routes are not just shorter (in terms of distance), but they are shorter\nBut the solution also raises visibility over your operations. You can actively track and monitor driver behaviour that affects fuel consumption, such as speeding or excessive idling.\nIn fact, drivers can impact the fuel economy of your organization by as much as 33%, according to the EPA.\nAnd when you do the math, one hour of idle time per day comes to 26 miles on the road during a year.\n4. Right-size the delivery fleet Owning vehicles is one of the highest costs of operating a private delivery fleet.\nIn fact, buying a new van can set you back a lot.\nIn the UK, the price is at least several thousand pounds.\nThis price guide shows how much it costs to buy a new commercial vehicle based on its type:\n Microvans (start at £6,495) Car-derived vans (start at £9,000) Pick-up vans (start at £15,400) Panel vans (start at £12,000)  In the USA, the estimated cost for a new van can be as much as $10,000 per vehicle.\nBut these prices don’t include the cost of insurance, registration, maintenance, and fuel.\nAccording to FleetLocate, the average upkeep for light-duty vehicles is between $5,000 and $8,000 per vehicle, per annum.\nAnd the larger your fleet, the greater the cost of owning it.\nThat’s why one of the biggest delivery challenges is to know how many vehicles you need to keep up with demand.\nWhile simultaneously maintaining cost-effectiveness at off-peak times.\nToo few vehicles and you risk not fulfilling order requests when demand exceeds your capacity.\nToo many, and you end up running up overhead on idle vehicles parked in your garage.\nThe solution is to right-size the delivery fleet with delivery management software.\nThis tool makes it easier to manage your fleet because it gives you complete visibility over the entire delivery.\nThat means you can track the performance and utility of each vehicle, and know exactly how many vehicles you need to fulfil all of your orders to maintain customer satisfaction.\nIn return, this information helps you to identify vehicles that are underused so you can remove them from your fleet and cut waste by right-sizing your delivery fleet.\nAnd based on the previous price list, eliminating just five vehicles from the fleet can save you up to $40,000 per year.\n5. Regularly maintain vehicles Maintaining your vehicles in solid working condition costs a lot of money.\nAnd while a routine service for every vehicle in your fleet is a major expense, it’s also a money-saving opportunity for most businesses.\nFor example, maintaining the recommended tire pressure and alignment helps you to lower fuel consumption and extend the longevity of the tires on your vehicles.\nAt an average cost of $128 per new tire, it’s a significant return on a sizable investment.\nSimilarly, regularly changing filters, lines and oil during a routine engine service improves their performance and prevents mechanical issues on the road.\nSo technically, it’s much more cost-effective to regularly tune-up vehicles than to lose money on expensive repairs, new parts, vehicle downtime, and missed orders.\nDelivery management software can help you to track the distance covered by each one of your vehicles.\nAll you have to do is connect the software with a telematics system.\nOnce you set it up, you can create alarms to notify you when a vehicle has reached a specific distance (5,000, 10,000 or 15,000 kilometres) and it’s time for a regular tune-up or tire change.\nThe software also makes it easier to plan better delivery schedules around those downtimes.\nIt means that you can closely monitor when a vehicle is scheduled for maintenance, so it doesn’t overlap with another.\nAt the same time, you can account for the shortage in vehicle capacity by diverting the tasks of a vehicle in maintenance to others.\nThis ensures that your drivers don’t miss any orders and the entire operation continues to run smoothly even when it’s short one vehicle.\n6. Make better use of space Like it or not, infrastructure is a key component of delivery.\nWithout facilities, it would be a lot harder to own and operate a delivery fleet.\nRegardless of whether you are looking to buy or rent space, infrastructure is a sizable expense when managing a delivery operation.\nOn the one hand, renting storage, office, and supply depots means a lot of monthly overhead.\nAdd to that physical stores and hiring a third-party delivery provider, and overhead can become a major operating expense (OPEX).\nOn the other hand, buying a building to house all your staff, vehicles, equipment, and supplies is a big upfront investment (or capital expense - CAPEX).\nEither way, you need to make the best use of available space to reduce overhead and get quick returns at the same time.\nDelivery management software can help you do both and more.\nFrom the point of infrastructure, a software solution like this centralizes the management process.\nAdopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics means that you have access to all operations from one location.\nSo instead of relying on multiple sites to manage multiple delivery areas, you can manage all of them from one central hub.\nSo it also becomes a question of whether you want to centralize or not to centralize delivery operations.\nThat means less need to invest in infrastructure in the first place.\nAt the same time, you can take a more granular approach to manage the use of space.\nThe software lets you maximize vehicle capacity, so the space inside is used efficiently.\nIn turn, you have better insight into how much products you actually need, which is the first step to improving the ordering process.\n7. Streamlines the ordering process. Effective ordering is responsible for two things: demand and supply.\nUnless you have a tight grip over delivery requests coming in and supply orders going out, you can end up wasting a lot of resources on:\n Too much stock of the same product Products with not enough demand Supplies that can\u0026rsquo;t sell quick enough Orders you can\u0026rsquo;t fulfil Lack of supplies  But streamlining the ordering process is complicated.\nYou have to track both supplies and deliveries to ensure the accuracy of orders coming in and out of your depot locations.\nAnd handling that requires a single software package.\nUsing delivery management software helps to increase order accuracy.\nThe software relies on cloud technology, which means two things:\n it can integrate with multiple other apps and software solutions via APIs, and; it automatically updates any changes across the entire ecosystem.  On the one hand, this ensures that any order you receive is created as one task, be it via your web store, Shopify account, or social media page.\nAnd once that task enters the system, it is visible across all dashboards.\nThat makes it easier to track inventory and prevents staff from ordering too much of the same products or supplies.\nBut you can always set up approvals so that nothing is ordered twice.\nWith increased transparency over the ordering process, you can also increase the supply order frequency.\nRaising the order frequency doesn’t directly cut costs, but it does reduce the time it takes to sell off your inventory.\nIn turn, that not only minimizes the idle time of your product in inventory but also raises returns and profit gains.\nReady to start cutting costs with delivery management software?\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

(Regardless of the industry you are in)\nThen, you’ll see why you should seriously consider upselling and cross-selling your products through delivery.\nAnd how to make it a reality in your company, step by step.\nLet’s start.\nWhat is upselling? Upselling (or selling-up) is a valuable sales technique to boost profits. It means getting customers to buy the same type of product but at a higher price.\nUsually, this is a larger, more feature-rich, or custom version of the product.\n“Would you like to upgrade to a large order?” is an example of upselling food delivery at restaurants and dark kitchens.\nWhat is cross-selling? The lines between upselling and cross-selling are often blurred. So, it’s easy to confuse them. But simply put:\nCross-selling is a sales strategy that involves getting customers to spend more money on a different product that complements the initial purchase.\n“Would you like a drink to go with your meal?” would be a cross-selling example at the mentioned food delivery.\nSo, what is the difference between an upsell and a cross-sell?\nAn upsell is a different version of the same product.\nAnd a cross-sell is a completely different product.\nNow, let’s take a look at why you need to do it.\nWhy are cross-selling and upselling important? Creating upsell and cross-sell offers isn’t a new thing.\nFor years now, Amazon and other ecommerce stores have been using these tactics on product pages and at checkout:\nMany other companies consciously create slightly different versions of the same product only to upsell them later.\nThink of the difference between an iPhone series model and a Plus version.\nThe only advantage of a Plus model is the size (and maybe some minor add-ons), while the price is sometimes over $100 higher than the original.\nSource gsmarena.com\nAnd businesses tend to create offers that supplement the original, increasing the order value:\n Free delivery with every purchase above a certain limit; A necessary accessory, like a case for a new smartphone; A discount with an additional item (buy one get one at X% off).  So it isn’t a question of whether upselling is better than cross-selling, or cross-selling better than upselling.\nYou should implement both because several key benefits can help you:\nImprove customer retention. Upselling and cross-selling improve your ability to retain more customers because it helps to resolve their pains more efficiently by recommending better solutions.\nBoth work in tandem to improve the customer’s experience:\n upsells help customers pick out a superior product from your offer; cross-sells help customers get the most out of their purchase with useful add-ons.  At the same time, it makes your company seem more knowledgeable in the eyes of your customers.\nAnd according to a recent survey, that\u0026rsquo;s important.\nAlmost 80% of people feel a knowledgeable service is an important part of a good customer experience.\nRaise the average order value and customer lifetime value. Upselling more expensive items or cross-selling additional goods raises the average value of each order.\nSo even with fewer sales, the price per order makes up for the difference in profit.\nAt the same time, this also boosts the lifetime value of your customers.\nSelling a more expensive item to a one-time customer means you get the biggest margins from every sale.\nGenerate more revenue. Product recommendations like upsells and cross-sells drive more revenue.\nIn fact, research suggests that it accounts for 10-30% of eCommerce revenue.\nAnd it’s a more cost-effective way to raise profit.\nIt provides much better returns on your lead generation and customer acquisition efforts since it raises the price per sale of every successful conversion.\nGain a competitive advantage. Knowing how to compete with Amazon, Walmart, Google, Apple, and other retail giants relies on your ability to co-exist with them.\nSo, it stands to reason that replicating their tactics levels the playing field and helps keep you in the game.\nMany small-to-medium businesses cross-sell and upsell with Shopify.\nBut adding such offers shouldn’t stop at checkout on your web store.\nYou should actively seek out new opportunities to raise your sales effectiveness. And doing it right on your customers’ doorstep is one such possibility.\nWhy should you cross-sell and upsell during delivery? Customers are more likely to decide on cross-sell or upsell offers during delivery.\nThis rests on at least a couple of things.\nFirst, customers value human interaction.\nIf your delivery drivers make a good first impression, customers are willing to let their guard down, listen to your delivery agents, and trust what they have to say.\nAs a result, customers are far more prepared to buy into a cross-sell or upsell pitch, especially if the delivery agent is capable of closing a sale.\nThe other reason why cross-selling and upselling during delivery works is because you offer it when the customer has already made a purchase.\nOn the one hand, the hardest part is over.\nYou have completed the sale, the customer has paid, and now he no longer has any objections about doing business with your company.\nIf your delivery agent comes to the customer with a superior product at a slightly higher price or a different product that instantly raises the value of their purchase, he will be inclined to consider the new offer.\nAnd when the customer weighs the difference in cost against the benefits of the new purchase, they seem many times lower than when he compares two products at checkout.\nThis makes your customers far more likely to accept upsell or cross-sell offers during delivery.\nIt’s also one of the main reasons cross-selling and upselling through delivery is one of the new trends in delivery management in 2020.\nNow, let’s take a look at how you can do it.\nHow to upsell and cross-sell products through delivery? In this section, you’ll see how to get started with upselling and cross-selling products through delivery.\nWe’ll walk you through key factors that affect upsell and cross-sell offers.\nNot to mention, how to handle inventory and operations, and how to execute all of these tactics to perfection.\nIn the end, you’ll have a better understanding of how to get it done, step by step. Here’s what you need to do:\n1. Decide when to upsell or cross-sell Effective upselling and cross-selling is all about timing.\nIf the timing is off, you risk upsetting your customers, since 40% of people are aware of these sales tactics.\nSo, first thing first, you need to decide:\n Who do you want to upsell and cross-sell to? (customers (B2C) vs. businesses (B2B) vs. both; all vs. initial vs. recurring vs. long-time customers) Where do you want to upsell and cross-sell? (the local last-mile vs. national or international delivery) When do you want to offer upsells and cross-sells? (before or during the drop-off; with a specific type of delivery like free home delivery or priority shipping; on certain days, or during seasonal sales events)  2. Decide what products to upsell or cross-sell Once you have a clear strategy when you want to offer upsells and cross-sells, you now have to decide what they are.\nAnd while your offer could include the entire product catalogue, it’s best to do some testing first.\nWith upselling, start with your best-sellers and move forward from there.\nIf your customers are stuck on those products, try recommending that they buy two or more of them at a discount.\nWith cross-selling, start matching different accessories to corresponding products.\nFor example, if you operate a beverage delivery, you can start to cross-sell pints with variety 12-packs, or taps with draught beer.\nAfter a certain period, you can change the offers and move on to test your other products.\n3. Test and analyze customer data When creating upsell and cross-sell offers, it’s critical to take some time to evaluate consumer data.\nThis might be useful for several reasons.\nFirst, it helps you identify the right customers for the pitch.\nTargeting returning customers might prove more lucrative since they have a history of doing business with your delivery.\nIn fact, according to Marketing Metrics, the authors point out that:\n “The probability of selling to a new prospect is 5-20%. The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70%.”\n Source: Groove\nYou can also use data to track movement on your website, including purchase trends.\nThis can help you to detect key products your customers consider before checkout, which may be a good upsell or cross-sell opportunity.\n4. Adjust your supply chain and inventory Without the ability to track and monitor orders and compare them to stock, depots get depleted quickly.\nDrivers end up leaving for their routes with empty vans.\nAnd they miss out on a chance to pitch offers to customers.\nSo before you start upselling and cross-selling through delivery, you need to adjust the supply chain and align it with your inventory.\nThis will allow you to maintain stock even when demand exceeds your capacity.\nFirst, you will either have to increase the supply orders, the supply order frequency, or the rate of production.\nSo you will need to consolidate all of your supply vendors to efficiently manage storage, as well.\nAt the same time, you will also have to evaluate key sites in the supply chain network.\nThis means choosing between planning at a depot level vs. centralized multi-depot planning.\nOnce you cover all of these points, you stock your vehicles full of products.\nSo not only will your drivers be able to upsell and cross-sell products, but you will be one step closer to building an agile delivery operation with storage on wheels to boot.\n5. Equip and train drivers and delivery agents As mentioned, analyzing data helps you create better upsell and cross-sell offers.\nBut collecting customer data helps your drivers seal the deal at the door, as well.\nUsing a driver app gives drivers access to vital customer information.\nThey can use that data to craft a personalized sales pitch and persuade customers to buy the upsell or cross-sell product.\nBut this still might not be enough to close a sale.\nSo, you should free up some resources to train your delivery agents in successful sales tactics, or start hiring solid drivers with a background in sales.\n6. Integrate a delivery management solution Upselling and cross-selling products during delivery depends on full control and visibility over every part of your operation.\nFrom the moment a customer checks out his purchase, to when a driver pitches the new product at his door, you need to have insight into every task and process before your drivers can start closing deals.\nThat requires a holistic approach to delivery management.\nSo, relying on a host of disconnected apps can’t cut it. Instead, you have to integrate an end-to-end solution, like delivery management software.\nTaking a platform approach to delivery management lets you plan, manage and review orders, supplies, inventory, and the fulfilment process all on one dashboard.\nSoftware solutions like these use APIs to integrate with any other system or app, like your website or your Shopify account.\nThis makes it easier for you to build on what you have, and upsell or cross-sell both online and live.\nThe tool can seamlessly handle dozens of tasks, orders, deliveries, vehicles, fleets, drivers, teams, and routes, all the while optimizing each part of the operation for maximum efficiency.\nThis means drivers spend less time focusing on how to get to your customer, and more time on how to best sell them your products.\nPlus, delivery management software offers other great features as well:\n Single or multi-depot planning Task scheduling Real-time delivery tracking Vehicle and driver management Electronic proof of delivery Customer data management Customer ratings and feedback Live reporting Reviewing delivery analytics  7. Start upselling and cross-selling your products Are you ready to start with upselling and cross-selling to customers with delivery?\nRemember, successful upsells and cross-sells are all about good timing.\nDon’t get us wrong. You should offer better deals, extra items, and useful add-ons on your website to motivate customers to spend more money.\nBut with product recommendations at the customers’ door, it will be easier to pitch the right upsells and cross-sells at the right time and to the right customer who will act on that offer.\nSo what do you think?\nIs it time to start upselling products to customers during delivery?\nOr do you have the ideal product to cross-sell with a bestseller?\nTo help you get started, we have a great offer.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

Both terms sound similar. Both of them have something to do with mapping out routes. But what do they mean? And are they the same?\nIn this post, you will see what\u0026rsquo;s the difference between route planning and route optimization. You\u0026rsquo;ll take a deep dive into their meaning and how each one works.\nAfter you read through the post, you will get a clear picture of which is which, and which one can have the best impact on your business.\nSo without further delay, let’s start.\nWhat is route planning? Route planning is closely connected with route mapping or route sequencing. Route planning is the process of creating driving directions (or routes) for multiple destinations on the map and putting them into an order that makes the most logical and practical sense.\nEach destination is based on a service or delivery order and represents the customer\u0026rsquo;s home or office address. In most cases, the orders are put on a list and imported into a route planner, or route planning software.\nWhat is route planning software? Route planning software lets you map out the most direct path from your starting point to each of your destinations in the shortest possible order. Technically, it creates a route that links point A with point B, all the way to point Z.\nA great example of route planning software is Google Maps. Using Google Maps to map routes with multiple destinations is a solid way to plan trips and journeys with a clear start and finish.\nGPS is another good example of a route planner. And a lot of businesses rely on GPS tracking devices to manage supply chains, delivery networks, and both internal and external fleets.\nOn the surface, automatically mapping routes with multiple stops using route planning software is a much better solution than using a pen and paper pad or excel sheets.\nBut managing routes for deliveries and field service operations isn’t as simple as creating a path from point A to point B. And once you dive beyond the surface, these problems become clear.\nRoute planners don’t take into account other factors that affect your operations, such as driver schedules, customer service, or reverse logistics. Not to mention, cost, output, and efficiency.\nSo once you dive beyond the surface, the problems become clear. And if you want to reach your company’s full potential, you need to find another, better solution.\nWhat is route optimization? Route optimization is a better way to plan, manage, and map routes. Route optimization helps you to excel in what you do by letting you create the most efficient routes based on other factors and constraints besides distance.\nWhen mapping a route, true route optimization software takes into account relevant parameters such as:\n Types of roads (urban roads vs. highways; single vs. double vs. multi lanes; one-way vs. two-way streets); Traffic patterns (traffic congestions during specific times of day (rush hours) or season (the Christmas rush), detours, roadworks, closed roads); Number of road crossings, roundabouts, traffic junctions, and stop lights en route; Crossing the line of traffic (left-hand (US), or right-hand (UK) turns); Pick-ups (wait time when picking up products, supplies, equipment, or field service workers); Depot locations (mapping multiple pick-ups at multiple depot sites); Determining the best access points (to enter or exit a street, road, or highway); Driver schedules (rest stops, lunch breaks, shifts); Vehicle type (speed, fuel consumption, cargo capacity); Delivery windows (exact deadlines, dates, times of delivery, urgent deliveries, fixed deliveries, regular weekly deliveries);  Take a look at the complete guide to route optimization software for 2020.\nWhat makes route optimization different? Route optimization plays a dual role when raising the efficiency of your delivery or field service.\nFirst, it improves customer service. And at the same time, the software makes it easier to track, monitor, carry out, and improve operations.\nRoute optimization makes customers more satisfied with their experience because it lets you meet their distinct needs and requirements when planning delivery schedules.\nFor example, route optimization can enable customers to pick out specific delivery windows (date and time) at checkout. Having a say when the delivery arrives helps customers feel more comfortable about their decision to choose your service.\nBut customers value choice beyond when and where their purchase arrives. Not offering flexible delivery options is one of the biggest mistakes in delivery management. Route optimization can help build up your offer to include:\n Standard 2-day delivery Free delivery once a week Next-day delivery Same-day delivery Local and city delivery Nationwide delivery Custom delivery  More choice means greater convenience. According to a survey about the future of CX, almost 80% of customers see convenience as an important part of their experience, while 51% of them are prepared to pay for it.\nSo, if route optimization makes it more convenient for people to use your delivery, it also means that they are more likely to spend their money with you. (Rather than your competitors)\nFrom a business perspective, it makes sense to boost the bottom line by giving shoppers a better customer experience.\nHowever, route optimization doesn\u0026rsquo;t just improve customer service. It also gives you greater control over your operations and how you manage them. And the benefits of that are huge.\nThe benefits of route optimization software: 1. Faster route planning and optimization. Are you still planning manually routes? It’s time to change.\nRoute optimization software lets you plan driving directions automatically. Instead of spending hours trying to formulate the best route, you and your planners can do it in minutes.\nAll you have to do is input a list of orders into the dashboard (in bulk or as a .csv file), and the system calculates the optimal route in a few minutes.\nThe software factors in all of the relevant constraints for every route and every driver, so you can easily plan your routes every single day.\n2. Better use of talent and employee potential. Not everyone is equipped to handle route planning. That’s why companies that don’t use planning tools regularly rely on a professional or a team of professionals to manage these complex tasks.\nRoute optimization software makes better use of these key individuals.\nFirst, the software makes it faster to plan, dispatch, and manage routes. When teams spend less time on route optimization, they have more time to focus on other key operations, like handling reverse logistics.\nThe intuitive user interface of route optimization software resembles standard SaaS solutions and apps on the market. That cuts the learning curve down to a few days, rather than weeks or months.\nSo instead of relying on one professional with advanced knowledge of distribution, supply chain networks, and the local geography, you can train multiple employees to handle plan routes with all of the relevant information at their fingertips.\nAnd when the route planner is out of the office, the operations can continue to run smoothly since you have a replacement close at hand to cover him.\n3. Real-time visibility over the entire operation. Once your drivers start their routes you lose control over where they are, or what they are doing. Technically, you remain in the dark when it comes to last-mile delivery, which means two things:\n You can’t track and monitor the performance and progress of your drivers; You can’t assign new tasks, pick-ups, or drop-offs on the go.  Route optimization software takes these problems head-on because it allows you to adopt a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics.\nCloud technology lets you keep track of all drivers in real-time, either by tracking their phones’ geolocation or the telematics in their vehicles.\nThe coordinates for each driver instantly update into the system and show up on the map on the dashboard. From there, operations managers and team leaders can track progress as a driver moves from one location to the next.\nAt the same time, drivers have access to routes via a driver app on their phones. Dispatchers and operations managers can add new tasks to driver schedules, while the system recalibrates the route to include the new stop.\nThe real-time routing, scheduling, and tracking capabilities of route optimization software make it possible to assign supply pick-ups, deliveries, and service visits as the orders for them arrive.\nReal-time visibility and control make your teams more flexible, which makes it easier to increase service speed, accuracy, and build an agile delivery operation.\n4. Save money with continuous optimization. Operating a delivery or field service requires significant investment to get started (infrastructure, vehicles, equipment), as well as overhead to run smoothly (payroll, utilities, maintenance).\nOne way you can reduce these costs is with route optimization software.\nAutomating the route planning process can lead to a significant cost reduction of both capital and operational expenses (as much as 50% according to delivery statistics).\nOn the one hand, real-time visibility lets you analyze operations and track key metrics in delivery logistics to know where your assets exceed the needs of your business. In turn, you can use the data to right-size your staff, vehicles, equipment, or infrastructure.\nFor example, tracking operations when demand exceeds capacity (peak seasons) helps you downsize the fleet so it remains cost-effective even when business is slow.\nOn the other hand, monitoring KPIs helps you to increase the efficiency of your operations by finding key opportunities to optimize performance and reduce the waste of resources.\nFor example, optimizing routes reduces distance and time to destination, as well as out-of-route mileage. Lowering these metrics can help you to decrease the fuel consumption of your fleet.\nBest of all, route optimization lets you raise efficiency and cut costs at scale, even when you implement delivery tactics to grow your operations.\nPut route optimization software to work for your business. Much like route planning and route optimization are worlds apart, no two software solutions are the same. And you have to find the right one to match the ambition and needs of your business.\nLuckily for you, these days there is a lot to choose from.\nRoute optimization is now a key component of specialized or end-to-end solutions, like delivery management software. But even as a platform module, all of these solutions have a few things in common:\n1. Automatically planning routes.\n2. Adding all relevant parameters to formulate routes.\n3. Improving customer service and experience.\n4. Increasing the speed of the route planning process.\n5. Raising output and performance efficiency.\n6. Providing real-time visibility and control over operations.\n7. Continuously improving the operational efficiency to cut costs.\nWhen you add it together and step away from the map, you can replace route planning with true route optimization.\nWhat do you think?

Scheduling is the act of planning deliveries for multiple locations, routes, and drivers so that you can achieve key tasks and fulfil every order in the time you have available.\nOn the one hand, it requires a logical approach to time management with a clear understanding of all the different factors that impact a delivery operation, such as:\n Other deliveries (mapping multiple delivery stops); Specified date and time (deadline to fulfill the order); Destination (distance to the drop-off location); Depot locations (distance to and from inventory sites); Geography (the landscape of the delivery area); Vehicle capabilities (capacity, speed, and fuel consumption); Driver availability (shifts, rest stops, and work breaks); Traffic congestion and speed limits; And many others.  On the other hand, it requires creativity to set priorities and make complex schedules that meet all these conditions without it affecting key objectives.\nThe importance of good delivery schedules Technically, scheduling deliveries is as much of an art form, as it is a science.\nWhen it’s done effectively, a good schedule can help you:\n Understand what your organization can realistically achieve within a specific time frame; Make sure there is enough time to plan, execute, and evaluate all tasks vital to completing each delivery; Add contingency time in case something unexpected happens during the delivery lifecycle; Avoid taking on more orders than your operations can handle (when demand exceeds your capacity); Make sure there is enough time to attend to each customer and maintain quality of service; Provide drivers and delivery agents with all the benefits according to their work agreements; Implement delivery tactics to grow your operations and achieve long-term objectives for the organization.  What many companies fail to understand is that time is a limited resource.\nIt’s the only one you can neither buy nor sell.\nBut it’s the one you waste or use ineffectively the most.\nThat’s why delivery schedules are so important.\nThey help you keep your operations on track as you achieve both short and long-term goals.\nHere’s how you can improve them:\nIdentify the time available for completing each task Even though most companies operate within fixed time windows, the time available to complete a delivery is never the same.\nIt can vary drastically from industry to industry.\nFor example, a schedule for a restaurant food delivery is different from a beverage delivery.\nAnd both are quite different from managing field service operations.\nBut it also varies a lot through different times of the week, month, or year.\nFor example, demand can spike around Christmas and dwindle during the summer holiday season.\nA good schedule also depends on the rota, or how much staff you have on hand.\nSo, you will also have to factor in work breaks, shifts, time off, and absence when determining how much time is available to you.\nBut a good rota is more than just having access to enough people.\nIt’s also about having the right level of staff to fill key roles necessary for meeting the essential needs of your delivery service.\nAnd for that, you have to strike the right balance to make sure the quality of your service doesn’t drop during peak delivery time while ensuring payroll doesn’t affect the budget during slower spells.\nAdditionally, you will have to factor in how much it takes to complete a delivery.\nOf course, this number can vary.\nBut if you calculate the average time per delivery you can have a rough estimate of how many deliveries your drivers can complete per route.\nOnce you have all of this information, and you know how much time you have available per day, you can start scheduling deliveries.\nSchedule tasks based on the priority of each order No order is the same.\nThat’s because no customer is the same.\nAnd if you want to create the best delivery schedule, you need to set the priority for every order.\nThink of it like a doctor using triage to determine which patient to treat first.\nThe seriousness of the injury or illness tells the doctor which patients have high priority needs, and which patients can wait for treatment.\nAnd this helps him to use his time efficiently so he can treat all of his patients.\nThe same logic applies when managing delivery schedules.\nIf you set the priority from highest to lowest for each order, you can plan better schedules because you know which deliveries come first.\nTo prioritize orders, take a look at your service offer.\nYou probably have a few different options besides the standard delivery. In most cases, the type of delivery will tell you which one to schedule first.\nFor example, this is one way to do it:\n1. Same-day delivery (because it is the fastest)\n2. International delivery (because it takes the longest to complete)\n3. Standard delivery\n4. 7-day free delivery (because you schedule them once per week)\nOn the other hand, if a specific customer has made an order or you have to deliver a more valuable product, then you can also use these factors to prioritize these deliveries in your schedule.\nImprove communication with your customers When it comes to scheduling deliveries, there is no such thing as too much communication.\nOn the one hand, talking to customers helps them to know what’s going on with their orders.\nIt makes them feel more involved in the delivery process, which helps you keep things on track.\nSo, it’s not enough to send a confirmation email after checkout.\nCustomer service has to follow up at least a few more times.\nSending order and delivery notifications keep customers in the loop about the date and expected time of arrival (ETA) of their orders.\nThis allows you to clarify the drop-off information before finalizing the schedule.\nIt also enables you to plan more accurately, especially when creating complex schedules across multiple locations.\nBut you need to take it a step further.\nFor example, send a tracking link to customers and let them know when the delivery is on its way via text message.\nTechnically, the more recent the information, the more accurate it is.\nCustomers are less likely to miss the drop-off if they have access to precise ETAs.\nIn return, you raise the rate of fulfillment.\nCustomers can plan their day around the arrival of their orders.\nAnd that means shorter delivery windows, less wait time, and fewer returns.\nAll of which has a positive effect on the timeliness of your delivery teams, and helps them to stick to the schedule across the entire delivery route.\nAnalyze performance and results Time is the resource companies waste the most.\nBut like other valuable assets, it’s critical to measure and evaluate how you spend it to know how to use it more efficiently.\nThat’s where scheduling helps.\nTechnically, a delivery schedule is a roadmap to how your operation uses time.\nAt the same time, this determines the effectiveness of your delivery schedules.\nFor example, if a driver completes all assignments according to his schedule with time on the clock, there is room to increase his workload and maximize the use of his time.\nOn the other hand, if a driver is regularly missing his delivery windows, then there is a problem that’s causing him to waste time.\nOr the schedule doesn’t allocate enough contingency time.\nEither way, getting the schedule right is absolutely critical.\nThat’s why evaluating the schedule step by step is the only way to overcome some of the biggest delivery challenges.\nBut there is a catch.\nBecause you have to create schedules on a day to day basis, it is easy to evaluate them but difficult to optimize.\nFor that, you will have to measure key metrics in delivery logistics, like time per delivery, on-time delivery, or transit time to distance.\nBut to calculate KPIs accurately, you need to have complete visibility over the entire operation to track and monitor performance and record results.\nAnd without integrating a software solution, this is almost unimaginable.\nUse software to plan better delivery schedules There’s plenty to think about when managing a delivery.\nThe delivery schedule is only one cog in a much larger engine.\nBut it does have to run effectively. Otherwise, your entire delivery can give out.\nThat’s why more and more companies across different industries use tools like delivery management software to handle their scheduling.\nBusinesses that invest in this kind of software experience a boost in productivity.\nIt also helps to save time, money, and other resources that go straight into strengthening the bottom line.\nTechnically, these tools make it easier to manage operations by allowing you to:\n Keep records of all deliveries and customers in one place Instant and full access to data relevant for delivery planning Automatically assign tasks to the nearest driver or delivery agent Reduce the learning curve and training time thanks to an intuitive interface Organize, coordinate and communicate with drivers and field agents remotely Track and monitor drivers and agents in the field in real-time Provide delivery tracking links to customers Collect feedback and service ratings from customers Collect reports and electronic proof of delivery from drivers Send SMS and email notifications to customers about the delivery status and ETAs Analyze performance data to optimize operations and make data-driven decisions  At the same time, CEOs and operations managers use these tools to empower employees.\nWith more efficient use of their time, teams feel less stress to complete even high-pressure tasks.\nIn fact, effectively managing their time and workload makes them more engaged on the job.\nAnd when your staff is more engaged, it’s easier for them to meet the requirements of their roles, and even outperform them.\nAs a result, happier teams can increase the quality of the service that they provide to your customers.\nIn return, high service quality is one of the best ways to boost customer experience and satisfaction.\nAnd better delivery will motivate more people to order more products or more services from your company, which has another positive impact on your margins.\nKey Notes: A good schedule is all about getting the right people to do the right task at the right place and at the right time.\nDoing this effectively enables your business to be more productive and deliver better service to your customers. So, remember:\n1. Calculate the time you have available to perform each delivery;\n2. Schedule deliveries based on order priority;\n3. Communicate more with your customers and workforce;\n4. Analyze results to optimize performance and reduce waste;\n5. And use software to effectively plan more efficient schedules.\nNow, it’s your turn to tell us what you think.\nHow can better schedules improve your delivery?\nHave you considered using software to automate operations?\nIf you have, but you’re just not sure what kind of tools your business needs, that’s okay.\nWe can help.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

Same-day delivery and delivery management software have revolutionized the way consumers shop.\nFrom a customer’s point of view, faster delivery is all about convenience. To support this, PwC did a survey on customer experience.\nFirst, they found that convenience and the shopping experience are the main driving forces that motivate consumers to choose a specific brand.\nFar more than the price of their products or services.\nAnd second, the survey also found that consumers want greater speed when shopping online.\nSo much in fact, that 88% of consumers don’t mind paying an additional fee if it means they will receive their order faster.\nA report by McKinsey sums up the benefits of same-day delivery nicely:\n “It integrates the convenience of online retail with the immediacy of brick and mortar stores.”\n From an operational point of view, faster delivery is all about automation.\nWithout software to plan, manage, and optimize your delivery, it is almost impossible to offer same-day delivery to your customers.\nAnd even then it is difficult to do it.\nBut if the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus has shown us anything, it’s that customers want fast home delivery.\nSo, if you can start offering same-day delivery to local customers, the rewards far outweigh the risks.\nAnd technology can get you there.\nHere’s how:\nGet the right order information before planning the delivery. An order is the primary source of data for each delivery.\nIt’s critical to accurately include the right information when planning routes around each order.\nOtherwise, drivers can get lost trying to find the correct destination.\nThey can spend valuable time fixing one mistake while creating a whole host of others down the line.\nIn the worst-case scenario, their efforts may be in vain.\nThey can just as easily miss their target destination completely while holding up other deliveries and missing ETAs for the entire route.\nAll of that can be averted before they set off on the route.\nHuman error is behind all these mistakes.\nWhile people are important for operating technology, whatever you do to minimize their involvement can raise the efficiency and accuracy of your efforts.\nSo if you plan to offer same-day delivery, you need to ask yourself: are you still planning manually?\nEven if you have moved from pen and paper to software to manage orders, it still doesn’t mean that you have automated the planning process.\nIn all probability, you are using a host of disconnected apps and manually typing in information onto a screen.\nSo, the question to centralize or not to centralize delivery is an important one.\nWhile there are advantages to decentralization, a centralized delivery management system can do a lot more for automating the planning process.\nFirst, modern software solutions can interconnect.\nYou can use API integration to link your order management system, for example, your Shopify account, with your delivery planning software.\nSo when an order arrives, all of the information is automatically added to the delivery platform.\nOn the other hand, if you are using Excel, you can export orders as a .csv file and use bulk upload to add all of them into the system all at once.\nOnce the right information is accessible, your route planners can create routes and map them out digitally using route planning software, geolocation, and GPS.\nWith a digital map at their disposal, drivers won’t have any problem finding the right address.\nOn the off chance the address is wrong, a driver can ask customer support to contact the customer and reschedule the delivery.\nHaving all the right information about the customer, their order, and delivery preferences in one place also make it easier for you and your drivers to provide a better customer experience.\nEnsure drivers have enough time with customers. Despite the need for speedy delivery, customers still crave human interaction.\nWith that in mind, it’s critical to give drivers enough time to talk to your customers.\nDrivers and field agents are the face of your brand.\nLetting them have a friendly conversation with the customer lets them make a good first impression.\nIt also builds relationships.\nCustomers usually have a product or service-related question.\nAt other times, they need help bringing in a package inside their homes.\nIf a driver has an extra 5-10 minutes in his schedule to help, it will prompt customers to place more trust in them.\nWhen you create schedules using software, you can easily allocate that time to each drop-off.\nWithout risking the timeliness of the entire delivery route, you ensure reliability and accuracy and add a personal touch to your service.\nAs a result, your brand will seem more trustworthy.\nAnd if customers start attaching emotions to your organization, they will start seeing it more as a person (via your drivers) than a company.\nFor example, that’s why many people don’t particularly like Amazon delivery.\nBecause of the speed of fulfilment, Amazon drivers don’t have time to interact with customers.\nIn most cases, they either leave the delivery at the door or have time for a brief encounter.\nSomething along the lines of:\n “Amazon Fulfillment.\nDelivery for Mr. Smith.\nPlease sign here.\nThank you.\nBye.”\n The introduction of fulfilment lockers, drones, and unmanned vehicles will make it even more difficult in the future.\nThis does give you a valuable opportunity to stand out.\nWith more focus on nurturing customer relationships, you can gain a competitive edge and you will know how to compete with Amazon delivery.\nAll it takes is an extra few minutes in your driver’s delivery schedule.\nIncrease the visibility over your operations. What happens when drivers set off on their routes?\nDo they drop off orders on time?\nOr do they miss those windows?\nWhy does that happen?\nAnd what about the delivery itself?\nWhy does the customer want to return it?\nWhy is he or she unsatisfied with your service?\nWithout software and visibility over your operations, you may never know the answers to these questions.\nThat’s because most deliveries that don’t use software leave a lot of the decision-making up to their teams on the ground.\nAfter a driver leaves the depot for his route, all managers can do is cross their fingers and hope for the best.\nAnd with something as dynamic as same-day delivery at stake, it isn’t very reliable to have little to no overview of the last mile of the operation.\nBut delivery management software can help you here.\nIn the same way geolocation and GPS allow you to map routes with multiple stops, the system lets you track driver (or delivery) location on that same map in real-time.\nThis gives you more control over the last mile.\nDispatch teams can track and monitor drivers as they move along their routes and follow up on their schedules and ETAs.\nIf a driver is delayed or misses a stop, managers can contact them to find out the reason and react to the situation.\nIf it’s beyond your control, for example, traffic congestion on the road, dispatch can reroute the driver and revise the ETA so the customer is aware of the delay.\nOn the other hand, if, for example, a vehicle breaks down, you can immediately dispatch the closest driver to pick up the load and send a repair team to fix or tow the vehicle.\nPlanners and managers can use driver tracking capabilities to plan routes and deliveries on the go.\nAs soon as an order arrives, the planner can look at the map, evaluate the fleet, and assign the task to the best driver based on that information.\nHe can then add a stop at the depot site and the new drop-off point, while the software recalibrates the new route.\nAnd since the system automatically updates the new information, the driver can access his app, see the change, and quickly pick-up the order.\nThen, he can continue along his route without too much interruption while he drives.\nAt the same time, delivery management software allows you to send out tracking links to customers.\nThis raises the transparency of your service and their orders.\nThe customer can access the link to check the date and time of arrival, and arrange his or her day accordingly.\nThere is less chance of a missed or failed delivery, and if there is a delay, the customer will be aware of it.\nAll of this ensures the maximum speed, efficiency, and quality of service with each delivery.\nNow it’s your turn to decide. Will you offer same-day delivery to your customers?\nAnd the software can take you there.\nWe can help with that.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

Deliveries get lost. Items get damaged en route. And hidden costs appear out of the blue.\nHow you handle challenges like these is what defines the success of your delivery operations. Not just how many orders arrive at your door.\nIn this post, you’ll take a look at some of the most common mistakes that happen in delivery planning. You’ll see the root of each problem, and how to effectively weed it out.\nWe’ll also let you in one solution that helps you handle all of them.\n(But more on that later)\nRight now, if you want to ensure that each product makes it to your customers' hands with every drop-off, this post can get you there.\nLet’s jump right in.\n1. Offering inflexible delivery options. Consumers value choice. If a person has no choice, he or she won’t have a sense of participating in the decision-making process. Too many choices and the individual is less likely to decide at all.\nThat’s the psychology of choice.\nAccording to expert Sheena Iyengar, consumers are six times more likely to buy a product or service if they face 5-7 different options.\nThe bottom line is that choice makes people happy. So, whether you run a food delivery in your restaurant or running an uninterrupted pharmacy delivery, it’s up to you to include four-five options along with your standard delivery.\nThere are several factors to consider. You can use speed, time of arrival, cost, location, and other factors to build your offer. The most common types of delivery include:\n Standard (2-day delivery) Free delivery (7-day or once per week delivery) Low cost, no-rush delivery (5+ business days) Next-day delivery Same-day delivery Local delivery (city or 3-5 kilometres) Nationwide delivery Regional delivery International delivery Custom delivery  Building up your offer around customers’ needs and preferences makes it more valuable. It\u0026rsquo;s also more convenient and flexible.\nAnd if customers see it as such, they will want to use it more, and buy more products at the same time.\n2. Overlooking same-day delivery. Your customers don’t have the patience to wait for weeks to receive their orders anymore. In fact, 44%, or almost one in two people want their order delivered within two days from the purchase.\nBut thanks to Amazon, and the companies’ move to free same-day shipping for their Prime members, even that has changed. The reality is that the entire market is focused on rapid fulfilment.\nThe good news is that customers are willing to pay for speed. According to a survey, 88% of consumers are prepared to pay for faster, same-day delivery.\nSo, there is room for your organization to offer fast delivery to customers. All you have to do is take advantage of this opportunity.\nThe solution is to focus on rapid local delivery fulfilment.\nOffering same-day delivery to customers closest to your supply chain means reducing delivery windows, but increasing delivery cycles. Simply put, a driver will complete multiple deliveries over multiple delivery runs.\nTo make this work, you will have to rethink your delivery strategy to remove non-essential steps via optimization.\nLuckily, the investment will pay off since most of your customers are prepared to reward your decision to offer same-day delivery.\n3. Overlooking free delivery. People love free shipping. In fact, it’s the top reason why 79.8% of shoppers in the US choose Amazon over any other company.\nSo, if you are looking to know how to compete with Amazon delivery, and other giants like Walmart, Dominoes, Alibaba, AliExpress, you have to expand your offer to include free delivery.\nHowever, many organizations are reluctant. Whenever someone puts the word FREE near a product or service offered, most companies assume they will lose money. But that’s not the case here.\nIf you increase the time it takes to fulfil an order and establish more expensive delivery options, you can offer free delivery without losing any money.\nFor example, you can set up a 7-day free delivery. The price of priority options (next-day or same-day delivery) could cover the operating costs. And because you drop them off once a week, order volume will maximize route density and minimize the cost per delivery.\nAnother way is to set the price based on different delivery zones. For example, you can offer free delivery at the local area (3-5 kilometres), while the rate for nationwide or international delivery would cover those costs.\n4. Miscalculating delivery rates. How do you deliver products or services to customers? Do you operate a private fleet? Or do you use a third-party provider instead?\nSelecting a delivery rate for your organization is vital if you want to have a positive bottom line and keep your customers happy. And that requires balance.\nIf the rate is too low, you risk making your delivery financially unsustainable. The price of delivery won’t be able to cover the cost of operations.\nOn the other hand, if the rate is too high, you risk disappointing customers. The price of your service (plus product) could scare them off, and lead them to your competitors.\nIf you use a third-party provider, then you should calculate the delivery rate manually. And there are a few different factors you should consider:\n Weight of delivery Distance to destination Order size and volume Number of products delivered  Here’s an example of how to calculate the price of delivery according to the average order weight:\nYou should also see how (and how much) your provider charges for their service. Most 3PL companies do it per:\n Vehicle Number of deliveries Time per delivery Weight Volume  Once you have the cost of delivery, you can add it as a surcharge, or directly include it into the total price tag (the price of product + price of delivery).\nIf you handle the delivery yourself, you can afford to lose money on different delivery options, like free delivery.\nAt the same time, you cover all operational expenses. So, you need to take into account payroll, fuel, vehicle and equipment maintenance, and other expenses when determining the price of delivery.\nThat’s why it’s also vital to reduce operational costs as much as possible.\n5. Not keeping operational costs low. Trimming the budget is an important part of the business. And when it comes to your delivery, it’s critical.\nUnlike production or sales, delivery isn’t a core business activity. So, you always have to maintain strict control over operational expenses.\nIf you don’t, costs can easily spiral out of control, eat into your profit margins, and be a burden for your customers. And your customers don’t appreciate paying for delivery.\nIn fact, when it comes to eCommerce statistics, it’s the biggest cause of cart abandonment among consumers.\nIf you want to prevent that from happening, you must look for cost-cutting opportunities:\n Add local delivery. Local delivery is the most cost-effective way to deliver products or services to customers. Even without a private fleet, building a local fulfilment service is easy. Since you only cover a small geographical area, it doesn’t require a 3PL provider, nor a lot of capital investment. Increase route density. Route density is the number of stops your drivers make per each route. The higher the density, the less it costs to fulfil each order, and the cost per delivery is lower, as well. Regularly send vehicles for maintenance. A delivery relies on its drivers and vehicles. And without proper care, your vehicles can break down during an assignment. If that happens, you end up losing money both on the cost of repair and the missed delivery. Sell products or services online. Online shopping doesn’t necessarily lower the cost of delivery, but it does increase profit. On the one hand, it’s more convenient for people to shop from home, especially regular customers. On the other, it enables you to reach a wider audience. And since there is more profit coming in, there is also more capital to make cost-saving investments. Automate the delivery operation. From optimizing route planning to letting you build an agile delivery, technology can cut costs more than any other solution. In fact, solutions like delivery management software can reduce operational expenses by 50%. And that’s why 44% of businesses plan to increase spending on tech in 2020 to save more money.  6. Not communicating with customers. Good communication is the key to excellent customer service. It’s what builds trust and nurtures relationships between your brand and your customers.\nStrictly speaking, it creates fans out of your customers. And according to Kevin Kelly, all you need is 1000 true fans to be successful.\nBut what most companies forget is that people talk to people. Organizations spend millions on ad campaigns and social media, without ever letting their employees speak to customers directly.\nThat’s a huge problem, especially in delivery.\nNot letting employees speak to customers (or customers to employees) creates a break in communication. It prevents your brand from listening to your customers.\nWithout hearing them, you will remain deaf to your customers’ pains, needs, preferences, and desires. And this can create a gap between what you offer and what customers actually want.\nAnd the problem is even worse when it comes to face-to-face interactions.\nIn delivery, a customer will get a first impression only after a delivery driver arrives at his door. And since the driver represents your company, how he presents himself is the measure of your brand.\nLetting your staff talk to customers, especially your teams in the field, can give your organization a boost in customer experience.\nFirst, it lets customer service listen to feedback and provide suggestions on how to improve your delivery. For example, if there is a repeating problem, customer service can point it out, and then team leaders can find a solution that works for the entire operation.\nDrivers can provide a much better service, as well. Sending a simple message to a customer before reaching the drop-off boosts the driver’s chances of leaving a good first impression:\n Hi John,\nYour delivery is 15 minutes away.\nSee you soon!\nMark from delivery\n A simple gesture like that gives your brand a personal touch to customer interaction. It makes a company, something distant and artificial, feel closer and more trustworthy, like a person.\n7. Not providing delivery tracking. Consumers love to be involved when shopping. That’s why fashion outlets have changing rooms, or why grocery stores allow people to smell, feel, and even taste fresh food.\nThe same reasoning applies to online shopping. Because the online experience is limited to sight (and sometimes sound), the more information people can see (or hear) about the product or service, the more they will feel involved.\nAnd when it comes to delivery, the principles are the same.\nCustomers want to be involved with their delivery as much as possible. They want to choose the date and time when their delivery will arrive, where it’s delivered, and even who delivers it.\nThey also want to be able to see where their delivery is at any moment in time. So, it’s up to you to make sure that they can.\nUsing delivery management software with geolocation and GPS positioning and tracking lets you monitor the location of each delivery operative in the field using a virtual map.\nAfter a dispatcher assigns a task to a driver, customer service can use the software to generate a tracking link and send it to the customer.\nThe customer can use the link to track his or her delivery in real-time. These links usually also show expected times of arrival, so customers know when the delivery will arrive and can plan their day accordingly.\n8. Safely packaging products for delivery. Unexpected things can happen to products before they are picked up from inventory. A lot more can happen further still en route to their destination.\nIn any of these situations, products can get damaged. It’s up to you to reduce that risk.\nThe safe packaging of your products ensures your products remain secure during transport. More importantly, though, it’s a guarantee that all items arrive intact to their destinations.\nFrom bags, boxes, and bubble wrap to pallets and wooden freights, there is a lot to consider when choosing the correct packaging. That also relies on the size, shape, and material of the items.\nBut the most important thing to remember is that the packaging you choose is durable, as well as branded and nice to look at.\nApart from that, you need to have adequate equipment to secure each package inside the vehicle. Shelves, containers, straps, and lashings all prevent the packaged items from moving as your vehicle goes through traffic.\nBeyond packaging, think about specialized vehicles. Some industries have specific standards or guidelines you will have to follow. For example, transporting medicine, or using refrigerated vehicles in food or beverage delivery.\n9. Ignoring vehicle capacity. Because there is limited storage space in each vehicle, the amount of products you can deliver per route is limited, as well. That means the capacity of your fleet is also finite.\nUnless order volumes match vehicle capacity, there is a good chance that drivers will have to resupply before completing all of their stops. This can help you plan multiple depot locations across the last mile.\nMoreover, vehicle capacity shows how much space you are wasting per delivery. If the space in a vehicle is not managed correctly, you are wasting valuable resources. So, you need to ensure that:\n The products in each vehicle are arranged according to drop-off locations. This makes it easier for drivers to unload deliveries sequentially as they move along their routes. There is room in the vehicle for drivers to manage deliveries. This allows them to enter the vehicle and offload items without having to move products around to get to the correct item. The space in the vehicle is used to its maximum capacity. Unless you use all available space in the vehicle, you are losing money. You are spending time, fuel, and man-hours on half-empty vans.  10. Replacing lost or damaged products. Despite your best efforts, mistakes can happen. A delivery may get damaged during transport. Or it may be misplaced at any point in the delivery lifecycle.\nIf this happens, you need to have a system in place that can deal with these situations fast and without too much hassle for the customer.\nReverse logistics help you handle the return of deliveries, regardless of the cause.\nFor example, if a customer isn’t satisfied with an item (his order got mixed up or the item was damaged en route), reverse logistics helps drivers to pick up a replacement and deliver it as soon as possible.\nIn case the item was lost or misplaced, drivers can easily contact dispatch and send the product with another driver.\nA fast reaction to unplanned situations like these is the hallmark of a good delivery. It’s what allows you to maintain a high quality of service, which keeps customers happy.\n11. Planning too big or too small. What area does your delivery cover? How big is it? Or how small? Answers to these questions determine the relationship between growth and profitability.\nSimply put, if you cover a small delivery, you risk expansion over profit. If you plan too big, you risk profit margins versus growth.\nTechnically, there has to be a balance. But after the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s better to plan small until you are certain the delivery won’t affect your bottom line.\nThe smaller the delivery area, the smaller the delivery market. At the same time, the delivery time window is shorter. So, it takes less time to fulfil an order with a much higher success rate.\nReducing your delivery to the local last-mile (5-10 kilometres) increases the route density while minimizing delays. And demand is high, you can expect order volumes to remain high, as well.\nThis also raises the speed of delivery. You can get an edge over competitors with fast fulfilment options, like same-day delivery.\nFrom there, you can use different delivery tactics to grow your operations and scale it over time.\n12. Planning deliveries during COVID-19. Covid-19 is here to stay. Even as people and companies settle into the new normal, there is still a lot of pressure on deliveries to keep the world moving forward. We have all felt it.\nThe state of delivery during the coronavirus has taught us that this will be the biggest challenge to operational management yet. And it’s affecting every industry, supply chain, process, and person.\nThird-party deliveries have altered their services and policies. Airports remain closed and flights cancelled. Government regulations change. Companies are facing staff shortages. **When demand exceeds your capacity **in the last-mile. Volumes increase every day. Contactless delivery is gaining momentum.\nIn this new, uncertain world, two things remain certain: there are challenges and there are possibilities.\nHow well you overcome delivery problems and take advantage of coming opportunities will define your operations and impact its success.\nAnd while you can’t go back to business as usual, there are measures you can take to keep your delivery afloat.\n Delays will happen. Take it into account, and be proactive about it. It’s a good idea, to be honest here. Let your customers know about the possibility of a delay with each order. If you are open about it and keep them in the loop, they are far more likely to accept the situation. Explore new ways of delivery. For example, consider contactless delivery. Use technology to enable drivers to talk to customers directly. This ensures the order is delivered, even if they maintain the 2m distance and leave it at the customers’ doorstep. Build a private fleet. While you may have weighed the pros and cons of having an internal vs. external delivery fleet before the outbreak, it’s time to stop outsourcing. 3PL companies have increased service fees, so it’s worth investing in your own vehicles and drivers to cut costs.  13. Losing sight of performance. Payroll is a big chunk of the overall costs of managing deliveries. And for your operation, that means team performance is closely tied to cost-effectiveness and efficiency.\nAt the same time, it is difficult to measure it. Albeit different teams and team members perform different tasks at different rates, the lack of insight can lead to a lack of output. So, visibility and oversight are key for tracking and managing their performance.\nBut too much active oversight can put pressure on your teams. The pressure to perform in combination with direct control can result in interruptions, frustration, and even burnout.\nUltimately, this hurts performance and causes a decline in output.\nSo, while it’s necessary to track output, you have to monitor it from afar both at the individual and organizational levels.\nThe solution is to find a balance between control and supervision.\nDeciding to centralize or not to centralize delivery operations is the first step.\nCentralization can help consolidate all of your assets to ensure greater control over your delivery. On the other hand, decentralization can give your teams more independence to perform tasks. A middle ground might be the best action plan.\nSimilarly, it’s important to automate your operations. But this begs the question: Are you still planning manually your delivery?\nIf you are, now is the time to stop. It’s time to choose delivery management software.\nThis type of technology makes it simple to monitor all your operations from one position. It gives you a total overview of performance at the office, as well as the field, and in real-time.\nThis makes it possible to track and evaluate performance without putting pressure on your staff or interfering with their work. And because you automate specific tasks, it also makes better use of each persons' unique talents.\nFor example, a route planner can focus more of his time on building better delivery strategies, and less time mapping routes with multiple stops.\nThat can lead to a better quality of work, better work conditions, and less inconsistency and inertia in output, as well.\n14. Dismissing delivery and shipping accuracy. Delivery accuracy is a major concern for fulfilment. It is closely linked to order accuracy or the perfect order measurement.\nMonitoring key metrics in delivery logistics like this one allows you to identify inaccuracies in the delivery process. It lets you keep track of failed deliveries, mistaken orders, returns, and damaged goods, and determines the success rate of your delivery teams.\nThese inaccuracies can happen across the delivery lifecycle, and at any point during the life cycle. That’s why identifying them involves monitoring each stage of the process:\n Procurement of products Inventory management Invoicing orders and deliveries Planning depot locations and pick-up Transporting deliveries and drop-off  You can use this simple formula to calculate order accuracy:\nA good workaround to this problem is to encourage drivers to submit reports using electronic proof of delivery.\nDrivers can submit reports with an app on their phone. The report automatically uploads to the main dashboard via cloud-technology. Dispatchers and operation managers can immediately access the information to determine order accuracy.\nAt the same time, ePOD lets customers leave feedback and rate drivers. That confirms or denies driver reports, as a system of checks and balances. And this ensures that if mistakes happen, they are transparent and easily resolved.\n15. Not automating delivery operations. The digital transformation has changed how many companies manage their deliveries.\nUnlike before, fewer and fewer organizations rely on simple pen and paper to manually plan routes. Disconnected apps and legacy solutions are also out.\nSo, as more and more companies are adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics, it is now the standard for managing operations.\nCompanies that don’t follow the latest delivery ma risk being left behind. Others cannot simply find that keeping up with the demands of the modern last mile is impossible without software.\nBut these powerful solutions are more than a necessity. They are also incredibly good for business.\nSolutions like delivery management software can automate the entire delivery process, from the first to the last mile.\nThat’s because these systems use different modules to tackle some of the biggest delivery challenges like:\n Route optimization Delivery planning and scheduling Depot management Inventory tracking Order management Proof of delivery Driver management Driver apps Customer management Delivery reporting Tracking KPIs and analytics And much more.  With such advanced features, it is possible to manage all operations from one centralized platform. Not to mention, minimize costs while raising output and performance at the same time.\nAnd the best part is that you can fix any mistake with a click of a button.\nLearn from your mistakes. Unless you take care of these mistakes, they can happen time, and time again. So, it’s vital to use these solutions to fix them as soon as possible.\nBut there is more.\nTo truly root out these problems, you have to learn from them. All of it counts for nothing if you end up letting them happen in the future.\nOffering flexible delivery options, maintaining quality, saving costs, using delivery management software to automate the process, and focusing on customer experience has a positive impact on your operations.\nSo, going forward, apply these solutions at every level of your organization.\nNow, it’s your turn. What’s the next step you will take?\nIf it’s automation, we have a software solution for you.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

Plus, we’ll show you the best solution on the market.\nLet’s get started. Here are the 9 biggest challenges to manually planning routes with multiple drop-offs:\n1. It takes too much time. Are you still planning manually?\nYou or your planners can spend hours mapping routes for drivers.\nEven then, chances are you might miss finding the best possible route.\nAnd you have to do it every single day, for every single driver.\nThe time you spend here could be better used elsewhere.\n2. It relies on key individuals. Manual planning is a complex task.\nWhat seems optimal on the map is often very different in practice. So, not everyone is cut out for it.\nOnly professionals with a working knowledge of distribution, geography, roads, and the supply chain network can find the most optimal solutions.\nWithout them, it’s impossible to consider manually routing multiple stops and drop-offs.\n3. It wastes talent. Whether you have an individual or a team in place to plan your routes, their potential is being wasted on this manual, repetitive task.\nAnd it can last for hours.\nMore often than not, route planners also have to sort and group orders based on service areas or postcodes. And then put together delivery schedules.\nAll of this takes even more time away from their workday.\nFinding the best route is also frustrating work.\nBurnout is a serious symptom of the job.\nAnd that can cause professionals to leave their jobs - a potentially severe loss for your organization.\nThe time, effort, and skills these pros bring to the table would benefit your business more effectively if they were assigned more meaningful tasks.\nFor example, developing tactics to grow your delivery operations.\n4. It doesn’t support dynamic routing. Without automated route planning, your pros need time to re-adjust delivery schedules and create new routes for drivers.\nTechnically, this makes it almost impossible to assign new deliveries on the go.\nThis makes you less competitive.\nYou are unable to improve the delivery offer to meet today’s standards, like same-day delivery.\nWhat you are left with is trying to focus on your local delivery area.\nBut even then, you waste valuable resources trying to generate speed and neglecting other aspects of your operations, like drive time or fuel consumption.\nSo, even if your team can create a new schedule and routes, it will still take them at least an hour to do it.\nAdd to that the time it takes drivers to make the trip to your supply depot, and fast delivery becomes unsustainable.\n5. It doesn’t support real-time visibility. With manual route planning, you can easily lose track of all the moving pieces on the map.\nAs soon as your drivers set off on their routes, you have no more control over them.\nUnless dispatchers keep a constant tab on them, there is no way of knowing where your drivers are or what they are doing.\nEven if you regularly check-in with drivers, it’s impossible to assign new tasks without locating everyone on the map first.\nAnd since everything is dynamic, as soon as a call ends drivers have already moved on from their last-known location.\nIt’s a problem for drivers, too.\nNot only does it make their assignments more complicated, but it can also distract them from the road.\nThat seriously raises the question of their safety.\nIf something happens to the delivery or the driver en route to drop-off, you have no way of knowing what, why, or where.\nAnd that leads us to the next problem.\n6. It is difficult to revise failed or missed deliveries. Mistakes can happen to any delivery.\nBut without a suitable software solution and visibility over the last mile, it is difficult to efficiently carry out returns.\nWithout automated reverse logistics capabilities, you have to manually correct those mistakes.\nIf the customer isn’t home, then the driver can simply return on his way back to the supply depot.\nBut if an item is damaged, you will have to:\n contact the driver to get details about the failed delivery; check the location of other drivers; find the best driver for the new task; plan a new route for him; and then bring the new item to the customer.  All of this takes too much time.\nDuring the wait, you risk losing the customers to frustration.\nAnd since small businesses rely on service quality to know how to compete with Amazon, Walmart, and other giants, it’s a risk your company simply shouldn’t take.\n7. It is difficult to scale operations. As the size and complexity of your delivery grow, you will manage larger fleets, cover greater service areas, and handle more order volumes.\nBut without the use of technology, it’s difficult for you to use proven delivery tactics to grow your operations.\nInstead of investing in software, you will either have to train or hire more planners both for existing sites and new service areas.\nThe larger workload and more staff also mean that the cost of payroll (and overhead) will go up.\nAnd as a result, you will need even more capital to expand operations.\n8. It prevents the tracking of key metrics. One of the biggest delivery challenges in eCommerce is cost.\nTechnically, there are also a lot of opportunities to save money through the optimization of last-mile operations.\nBut that requires you to track key metrics in delivery logistics.\nWith manual planning, this process is difficult.\nIn fact, keeping track of KPIs by hand can lead to more waste of valuable resources.\nFor example, if you have to calculate the cost of fuel, drivers would have to keep track of how much fuel their vehicles consume per route.\nDepending on the type of vehicles in your fleet, those numbers might be imprecise.\nOnce they collect the data, planners can process the information for each vehicle and calculate the cost per mile or delivery\nAnd this is only one key parameter you have to consider.\n9. It doesn’t support advanced technology. Free route planning software solutions are usually limited tools.\nIn most cases, you can only plan one route at a time.\nAnd again, you have to input information by hand.\nFor example, if you use Google Maps, you can easily create routes from point A to point B.\nBut if you have to add more than one stop on your route, things become more complicated.\nPlus, Google Maps can only support up to ten different stops per route.\nNot to mention, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically select the most efficient route. You will have to do that by hand, as well.\nAll of this is a challenge when you have to plan for dozens of routes with multiple destinations.\nBut there is an answer to all of these problems.\nThe solution is route optimization software. A multiple stop route planner is an optimization tool.\nThe main goal is to automatically create routes for drivers around dozens of drop-off locations.\nAt the same time, the planner adjusts routes for the optimal time, fuel, delivery windows, vehicle capacity, driver’s lunch breaks, and countless other factors.\nModern solutions map out these routes automatically at the click of a button.\nAnd by adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics, anyone on your team can access it from anywhere.\nA user-friendly interface also cuts the learning curve in half.\nThat means that you won’t rely on a handful of pros to plan routes.\nInstead, you can train a member from each team to use the software.\nAnd within a matter of days, you can ensure that operations can continue without a hitch even when someone is out of the office.\nThe best part is that route optimization software is just one part of a larger ecosystem.\nIf you choose delivery management software, you can gain access to even more capabilities like:\n Depot planning and management; Fleet management; Delivery tracking and monitoring; Automated delivery scheduling and routing; Electronic proof of delivery; Delivery apps for drivers; Analytics and reporting; And more.  But we\u0026rsquo;re here to help.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

Centralization and decentralization apply to all business activities.\nTechnically, every process is determined by one of two paths.\nIt is a consolidated approach.\nOne that relies on key people to make decisions that shape the processes for the entire organization.\nOr, it is a delegated approach.\nOne that leaves the decision making to teams based on their working knowledge and expertise.\nAddressing the topic, thought leaders at McKinsey proposed three key questions in this article.\nA yes to at least one opens the road for you to centralize.\nA no to all three and you should dismiss the notion.\nSource: McKinsey\n1. Is centralization mandated for your delivery? A positive answer to this question means you have little choice in the matter.\nIf you outsource deliveries to a third-party logistics provider, then usually you have one person communicating with that company.\nOn the other hand, if you have multiple fleets covering multiple delivery areas, you probably have a manager responsible for each site.\nIn this situation, centralization is not mandated and the answer is NO.\n2. Does centralization add significant value to your delivery? A significant problem of this question is how to determine value.\nThe solution is to gain clarity.\nTo do this, set a high goal. If it is high enough, the benefits of centralization will clearly outweigh the disadvantages.\nThe experts at McKinsey suggest asking the question:\n Does the proposed initiative add 10 percent to the market capitalization or profits of the corporation?\n For example, if you integrate route optimization software, will this tool reduce the costs of your operations?\nOr will it add more overhead?\nWill it simplify route planning?\nOr complicate the process for everyone involved?\nIf the answer is negative, there is little room for centralization and you can move on to the next question.\n3. Are the risks low for your delivery? More often than not, the value that centralization generates is uncertain.\nOr it takes a long time for you to evaluate it.\nIn this situation, you have to weigh the risks to your organization.\nIf the risks are insignificant, you can carry out the plan to centralize your delivery.\nFor example, a plan to manage operations using a delivery management platform will likely get a positive answer to this question.\nYou can clearly cut costs if you use one tool instead of a host of disconnected apps.\nOn the other hand, if that software isn’t compatible with other key software, then the additional resources can be better spent elsewhere.\nIf you don’t get a YES from at least one question, you should rethink your plan to centralize before moving forward.\nA decentralized approach to delivery operations. Each delivery follows different stages in its lifecycle.\nAnd each stage has a different structure, process, and person at the helm.\nA decentralized approach to delivery management is grounded on each of those individual parts in your organization.\nEvery aspect operates independently from the other and within the limits you set. This can be based on:\nLocation You manage each delivery area separately.\nEach location can receive orders and fulfil them independently from other sites.\nIt has the infrastructure, fleet of vehicles, depot locations, and workforce in place to complete every stage of the delivery.\nProcess You manage deliveries stage-by-stage.\nAt each stage, there are people, infrastructure, equipment, and tools in place to independently carry out specific tasks.\nOnly when one task is completed (for example an order is received), the process can move forward to the next stage until you fulfil the order.\nTeam. You manage deliveries at a team level.\nSpecialized teams are responsible for completing specific tasks at specific stages of the delivery process.\nEach team has a set of goals they have to achieve to fulfil an order.\nWhen you combine their efforts, you can see the results of the organization as a whole.\n This kind of organizational planning relies a lot on individuals.\nEach person is a professional in his or her field of expertise.\nThat person is also responsible for performing unique tasks and achieving specific results.\nFor example, a route planner has to plan the best delivery routes for your drivers.\nAt the same time, he has to address key metrics in delivery logistics.\nIf he has to achieve a specific cost per delivery, he will increase route density (number of deliveries per route) to maximize cost-effectiveness.\nThis gives your staff a lot of independence.\nEach professional on your team can make decisions and take action based on the best possible outcome for your organization.\nThe decentralized approach also gives managers and CEOs more freedom to delegate.\nRather than passively waiting for orders, this lets you empower employees to take a proactive role in your organization.\nDistributing responsibilities like this will reduce the pressure of managing large scale delivery operations, especially at the enterprise level.\nAnother benefit is local talent.\nMany decentralized organizations hire professionals close to their delivery networks.\nTheir working knowledge of the local roads and supply chains makes planning deliveries at new sites.\nIt also makes your organization more flexible.\nRemoving the need to train and deploy teams when opening up new networks lets you apply proven delivery tactics to grow your operations.\nInstead of sending regional managers from your central offices, you can rely on new hires to put your plans into action.\nInadvertently, this cuts the time it takes to bring a new site online.\nBut despite the benefits, decentralization isn’t without its downsides.\nThe disadvantages of decentralizing delivery operations. The disadvantages of a decentralized approach to delivery are closely tied to its benefits.\nThere are several things you have to consider:\nReplacing key team members is difficult Because each professional is hand-selected for his role, finding a substitute isn\u0026rsquo;t simple to achieve.\nIn case of a long absence due to illness or injury, their extensive experience can turn into a hindrance to day-to-day operations.\nOn-premise solutions prevent easy transition If you manage each delivery network separately, the software is likely unique to those sites.\nIn case you have to replace a staffer, the learning curve prevents new employees from their immediate integration into the role.\nSpecific equipment is tied to specific locations Because each delivery area is independent, it is difficult for you to consolidate all your assets.\nFor example, when demand exceeds your capacity at one location, you have to jump through hoops to distribute resources to meet those requirements.\nGoing nowhere fast The level of expertise of professionals at different locations means they spend most of their time completing basic tasks.\nOn the one hand, it can be difficult to maintain their morale.\nAnd on the other hand, sending them to new offices means retraining employees to fill their roles at existing sites. In both cases, turnover is suffering.\nLack of control Without central oversight and visibility, it is difficult for you to monitor the performance of specific teams.\nThis can result in inconsistency and inertia at various levels of the delivery process, which can seriously affect the output of your operations.\nIt also prevents you from applying strategies that drive change across the organization as a whole.\nNow it’s time to move on to a different approach.\nA centralized approach to delivery operations. At its core, a centralized system is based on consolidation.\nInstead of treating each process, person, or structure independently, it combines them into a single more effective whole.\nHere, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\nAnd one central hub is responsible for managing the entire delivery operation.\nTo do this, centralized deliveries leverage standardization, collaboration, and communication across the entire organization:\nAll assets are managed holistically The CEO, operations managers, and team heads have access to the same resources.\nYou can actively use these resources and distribute them directly to meet the requirements of a specific situation.\nAll teams receive orders from one place Because the entire operation relies on one order management systems, planners and schedulers can work together when assigning deliveries to drivers.\nAll teams can collaborate on different tasks. Sharing data and resources across teams, stages of delivery and processes make it possible to streamline operations.\nIf, for example, a vehicle breaks down, managers can quickly find a replacement vehicle or driver to complete the delivery run.\nAll teams have access to the most modern systems Most companies today take this approach because they use modern technology.\nSystems like delivery management software make it possible to view, review, and assign tasks for maximum impact and the most efficient results.\nAll strategies are applied company-wide. A centralized approach makes it possible to create, adopt, and evaluate tactics that solve the biggest delivery challenges.\nIn turn, you can optimize operations for maximum performance sooner rather than later.\nAll teams use the same lines of communication Since strategies and technologies are adopted across the company, it is easier to set up one channel for communication.\nThis enables information to flow both top-down (from management down to staff), and bottom-up (from staff to managers).\nIn taking this approach to delivery management, you can achieve greater consistency both in terms of performance and growth and scalability.\nAnd because everyone is on board, your entire organization is always moving forward.\nIs there a balance between a centralized and decentralized approach? Yes, there is.\nThanks to disruptive technology, like delivery management software, the game has changed.\nBefore, small and medium businesses relied on manual planning, while large enterprises could afford to use on-premise solutions.\nThe lack of suitable solutions meant most companies had to adopt a decentralized approach to their delivery operations.\nBut today, things are different.\nCloud computing has made it possible for SaaS companies to offer quality solutions at the fraction of the cost, and with greater functionality than ever before.\nTechnically, it’s impossible to imagine an operation that isn\u0026rsquo;t adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics.\nInadvertently, this has opened many doors.\nTechnology has allowed more companies to centralize their operations.\nAt the same time, it enabled more companies to experiment when finding the approach that works best for their organization.\nAnd in fact, this has led to a fusion.\nA company with a centralized delivery operation can now decentralize specific processes using the software.\nFor example, you can use the same platform to plan, route, and dispatch deliveries for drivers.\nSimultaneously, integrated apps for drivers allows them to communicate with customers directly, and independently from the central hub.\nThis can open your organization to new delivery management trends, like letting drivers upsell favourite products or services directly to your customers.\nAnd with this third approach, the question is different than before.\nTo centralize or not to centralize your delivery? That is the question that is on every manager’s mind. It’s what keeps them awake at night.\nBut that’s not the question you should be asking yourself.\nInstead, ask yourself the three questions from the beginning of this post.\nA yes to just one can set you on the path to centralization.\nEven then, opening a debate with your team can help you to build a strategy that works best for your company.\nCreate a level playing field for both sides of the argument to strike the ideal balance between centralization and decentralization.\nAnd let delivery management software help you find the answer.\nWe can help with that.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

And take advantage of new opportunities post coronavirus.\nAnd we’ll walk you through the whole process, one step at a time.\nLet’s get started.\nOffer beverages beyond your physical store. The beverage industry is a large and mature market.\nWhen combined, the revenue of alcoholic drinks and the revenue of non-alcoholic drinks is $2,409,439 million worldwide.\nBut unlike food delivery, the online sale and delivery of drinks account for only a fraction of that revenue stream.\nIn fact, only 2.4% of all beverages are sold online, and only 1% of total alcohol sales.\nLuckily, the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus is changing things.\nSo much, that according to research from Nielsen, online alcohol sales are up 243%.\nThis is causing most drink producers and retailers to rethink their offers.\nFrom large distributors to small breweries and organic juice producers, more and more companies are moving their offer online.\nMind you, most of them still do business at their physical stores.\nOnly now, it also serves as a pick-up point for the delivery of online orders.\nBut online beverage delivery comes with a few concerns.\nThe most significant concern among consumers is the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors.\nAccording to the Washington Post, Uber Eats and their drivers have been delivering cocktails and alcohol without ID’ing or even seeing the customer first.\nBut those aren’t the only concerns.\nIf you are to successfully move (at least half of) your sales to the website, it’s necessary to overcome other obstacles associated with delivery and fulfilment.\nThe challenges of managing order fulfilment of drinks. Delivering drinks is a simple concept.\nYou receive orders and deliver them from point A to point B.\nBut once you build a delivery, you realize there it’s much more to it than that.\nThat’s why delivery and pick-up is a common pain point for business owners.\nAnd solving this pain demands the ongoing improvement of the delivery process.\nBut before you start optimizing, it’s crucial to know what are the biggest delivery challenges:\nDelivering drinks to customers has to be fast. Your customers are thirsty.\nAnd it’s your responsibility to quench their thirst as fast as possible.\nOn the one hand, any type of food and beverage delivery is time-sensitive.\nSignificant delays can affect the quality of your product.\nThat’s why you have to speed up your delivery.\nAfter all, it’s what customers want.\nIf you offer delivery at the local last-mile, it’s important to start managing in real-time.\nThis can help you cut time per delivery, so you can handle more deliveries at the fraction of the cost.\nIf you distribute beverages at a much larger scale, speed can allow you to offer same-day delivery.\nAnd that can help you co-exist with much larger competitors, like Amazon, Walmart, or Wholefoods.\nEnsure customers always get what they want. Order allocation is an important part of maintaining quality control and customer experience.\nAllocating orders correctly means delivering the right brand, on the right day, at the right location.\nKeep track of inventory if you want to maintain stock. Tracking inventory relies as much on your supply chain network, as it does monitoring the flow of goods.\nWhen you don’t have a clear view of how many products are moving upstream vs. downstream, you can end up using up all your stock.\nIf that happens, it is difficult to maintain fulfilment and delivery volumes.\nNot to mention, without reliable inventory tracking, you won’t have sufficient insight to improve last-mile delivery when demand exceeds your capacity.\nRaise visibility over the entire supply chain. A supply chain has well-defined steps.\nIt has a start and a finish.\nIt has the first and the last mile.\nThat is why looking at the entire process from a wide and a narrow-angle is key to identifying opportunities on how to improve it.\nWithout a complete overview of all operations, your organization can miss out on key opportunities to optimize.\nVisibility is the solution.\nIt gives you complete control over how you produce, source, and distribute drinks across the entire supply chain network.\nIn turn, you will have the range to fulfil any order volumes despite the demand.\nGain transparency over the last-mile. Delivery tracking allows you to know the location of every delivery at every moment.\nThis ensures a seamless transition from pick-up to drop-off.\nIt even lets you share that information with your customers for better customer experience.\nCommunicate with your teams and customers more effectively. Communication determines the success of each delivery.\nEquipping teams with technology that lets them instantly share and access data, allows you to build an agile delivery operation.\nIt also empowers your staff to extend the line of communication directly to your customers, so they can provide a better service.\nAnalyze the performance of your delivery teams and operations. Monitoring performance is critical for reducing operational waste.\nIt helps you find opportunities for optimization.\nMeasuring key metrics in delivery logistics like the average cost per delivery is vital for this process.\nWithout key performance indicators (KPIs), you won’t be able to make adjustments and test them against benchmarks.\nCreate a fast and agile system that can handle returns. Delivery is an active process.\nDespite your best efforts, sometimes things can happen that are out of your control.\nFor example, a customer may receive the wrong label of spirit.\nA pallet of soft-drinks may arrive at the wrong store.\nOr a case of wine may be damaged en route to the customer’s restaurant.\nReverse logistics helps you overcome all of these issues.\nIt allows you to turn failure into opportunity, so you can keep costs low while maintaining high customer satisfaction at the same time.\nDelivery management software can optimize drink delivery and pick-up. From food delivery for restaurants to field service operations, technology is transforming how businesses manage deliveries.\nAnd software is a key part of that disruption.\nBut what is delivery management software, exactly?\nSimply put, it is an end-to-end solution for handling logistics.\nIt allows you to manage, optimize, and perform all tasks related to your delivery process.\nTypically, companies see it as route optimization software.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s also much more than that.\nYes, it allows you to automatically plan deliveries around the most efficient routes.\nBut it also lets you, for example, increase the route density of each delivery run.\nDrivers and field agents can handle more drop-offs and, thus, reduce your cost per delivery.\nIt can minimize drive time per delivery and speed up fulfilment.\nFor example, companies that deliver time-sensitive orders can ensure the speedy delivery of drinks like ready-to-order cocktails.\nBut delivery management software also allows you to supply beverages to stores, restaurants, and other businesses.\nThe tool can handle multiple tasks, teams, fleets, and vehicles regardless of size, scale, or order volume.\nFor example, it can just as easily handle ten fleets of dozens of vehicles, as it can one fleet with only one vehicle.\nBut it offers many other capabilities:\n Single or multi-depot planning Task scheduling Real-time delivery tracking Vehicle and driver management Electronic proof of delivery Customer data management Customer ratings and feedback Live reporting Reviewing delivery analytics And more.  With visibility at the operational, as well as the cellular level (task, driver, route, account, or customer), you will never miss an opportunity to evaluate performance.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the key to optimization.\nAnd if you are only just now thinking about delivering drinks to customers, it’s time to get started.\n2020 is the year to break into drink delivery. Now, it’s your turn.\nIf you haven’t already, this is the year to set up a delivery service.\nAfter all, Henry Ford said:\n “If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always got.”\n So, don’t wait for your customers to come to you.\nBring drinks directly to your customers.\nIf you have delivery but you need help scaling, use these proven delivery tactics to grow your operations.\nAnd remember to optimize your operations.\nLet technology do the job for you.\nFind opportunities for optimization. Make adjustments. Analyze performance. Repeat.\nIn no time at all, you will have a beverage delivery service that will run at maximum capacity and your customers will adore.\nAnd to help you get started, we have a great offer on the table.

Let’s dive right into it.\nGeneral Delivery Statistics  15.05 billion deliveries are completed worldwide in 2020. 704.7 million people will use platform-to-consumer delivery in 2020. The average cost of delivery is $6.4 per cubic meter. The average time per delivery is 12 minutes. Standard delivery takes approximately 3-5 business days to be completed. 66% of customers prefer home-delivery to any other type of delivery service. 70% of those customers are content with the cheapest form of home delivery option, while 23% of them would pay a premium price for same-day delivery. 55% of shoppers in the US prefer same-day delivery to any other time of arrival. That’s because 58% of consumers don’t want to wait more than 40 minutes for their deliveries to arrive.  It’s also why 30% of the total market share of priority same-day delivery belongs to the United States. But, in general, nearly half, or 44% of customers don’t mind waiting two days for their delivery to arrive. The reason is free shipping. 95% of consumers prefer free-one-day delivery as their ideal delivery method. And 48% of customers will add more items to their shopping cart if it means they qualify for free shipping. Companies that add a free shipping threshold can increase orders by 90%. This will see the last mile delivery market grow to $91.5 billion by 2030. A $79.5 billion rise compared to the value in 2019. And if forecasts for 2030 are right, there will also be a 78% increase in last-mile deliveries in urban areas across the world.  eCommerce and Delivery eCommerce is driving delivery. That’s why 10% of all retail sales were completed online in 2019. At least 82% of all global consumers have shopped online in the previous three months. Worldwide eCommerce retail sales will reach $4.9 trillion by 2021.  When it comes to online shopping, a survey by Nielsen suggests these are the most common items you will find at checkout:  But online shoppers in the US are willing to pay up to $5 for shipping. And this makes the last-mile worth approximately $115 billion out of the $270 total revenue pool from eCommerce.  Amazon Delivery Amazon is a key player in eCommerce. That\u0026rsquo;s why 68% of all US consumers begin their search on Amazon. It’s one of the reasons Amazon.com has been able to generate $280.5 billion from eCommerce. However, Amazon shares fell from 42% before the COVID-19 outbreak to 34% in April 2020. But that’s not going to stop the company. Amazon has the largest delivery infrastructure in the world with 390 warehouses and over 20,000 delivery vehicles. It’s one of the reasons why it costs $16.2 billion to run Amazon’s reverse logistics operations. Still, 72% of Amazon deliveries are fulfilled within 24 hours for all of their customers. That, and the ability to offer free shipping is why 79.8% of shoppers in the US choose Amazon. Other key factors include a broad selection of offers (68.9%), Prime membership (65.7%), and best pricing (49.2%).  Delivery Statistics by Industry  Key delivery statistics appear in every industry, including yours. For example, 32% of the furniture in the US will be sold online and delivered to the customers’ homes by 2023.\n  When it comes to food delivery, the sale of grocery delivery and pickup in the United States has grown by $6 billion from August 2019 to June 2020.\n  The number of orders has also increased from August 2019 to June 2020 by 68.9 million orders thanks to COVID-19.\n  By contrast, only 1% of total alcohol sales in the US are completed online.\n  And 41.7% of US consumers likely to purchase food online due to the Coronavirus\n  However, 61% of consumers don’t expect to spend more on grocery delivery due to the outbreak of COVID-19. But, 17% say they will buy more groceries online.\n  Nonetheless, there are 1,231.9 million food delivery users in the world in 2020.\n  And in 2024, the number of platform-to-consumer delivery and restaurant-to-consumer delivery will be 965.8 million each.\n  And with a 25% year-over-year growth, the food delivery industry will rise to $182 billion by 2024.\n  But it isn’t without its problems. In fact, 70% of all customer complaints with food delivery have to do with mismanaging the quality of service. That’s 6 out of 7 people. The most common complaints are the food isn’t warm or fresh enough (17%), the delivery is late (16%), incorrect order (12%), and that customer service ignores notes or instructions (12%).\n  On the other hand, 52% of delivery personnel cite food orders not being ready for pick-up as their biggest complaint. This doesn’t prevent 79% of consumers choosing delivery over takeout if the restaurant is more than 3km away. And even 34% of consumers usually pay up to $50 per delivery when ordering food online. That’s why 31% of people in the US use third-party delivery services at least twice per week. 59% of third-party logistics companies in the US believe that last-mile delivery is the most inefficient process in their supply chain. When it comes to healthcare and pharmacy delivery, only 1% of the total $275 billion in revenue came from online purchases. But by 2026, the global ePharmacy market will grow to over $177 billion (17.2% CAGR). A rise of 643% than the current market value.  Innovations in Delivery 44% of businesses plan to increase their spending on technology in 2020. 51% of companies are willing to invest in automation due to the coronavirus, with eCommerce (66%), food and beverage (59%), and third-party logistics (55%) companies more likely to invest than others. 41% of supply chain professionals say that data analysis is their top priority for tech innovation. Cloud technology and IoT follow with 39%. 46.1% of professionals are taking the cloud-first approach to manage delivery logistics. 37% of companies have already adopted some form of AI in their day-to-day operations. But only 12% of supply chain professionals are successfully implementing AI in their operations. 43% of companies that adopt automation have seen significant or moderate help during the pandemic. 81% of supply chain professionals also see automation as the driving force behind reusable transportation packaging. And another 16% of last-mile delivery retailers and logistics providers mentioned electric vehicles among the most important next steps in the evolution of deliveries.  Sustainable Delivery and the Environment 43% of shoppers in the UK are willing to look for an alternative if a company doesn’t offer sustainable delivery options. 60% of millennials shop online because they believe it leaves a smaller environmental footprint. 49% of companies have sustainable supply chain goals, but 35% of their competitors lack them completely, according to an MIT study. The number of delivery vehicles in the top 100 cities around the world will increase by 36% by 2030. As a result, emissions from delivery traffic will rise by 32% and from traffic congestion by 21%. Innovative solutions, such as data-based connectivity, dynamic scheduling, route optimization, and load-pooling, could reduce CO2 emissions by 30%, congestion by 30%, and delivery cost by 25%.  Delivery and Customer Experience  90% of people in the US cite customer service as a major driving force when making a decision.\n  59% of consumers will never do business with a company after two or three negative experiences.\n  96% of all customers say customer experience is an important part of their loyalty to a brand.\n  13% of shoppers never return for another purchase if the delivery doesn’t arrive on time.\n  80% of customers cite convenience, speed, knowledgeable help, and friendly service as the most important elements of good customer experience.\n  86% of customers believe retailers should offer them the ability to choose the most convenient delivery option when ordering their goods.\n  47% of customers say the delivery option they want is sometimes, rarely, or never available to them.\n  61% of customers report that online retail companies have the delivery options that they want.\n  Only 46% of direct-to-consumer brands offer delivery options that customers want.\n  34% of consumers say long delivery time is the key reason to shop in physical stores instead of online.\n  46% of consumers abandon online shopping carts if the shipping time was too long or wasn’t provided.\n  86% of customers are willing to pay more for products and services, and buy more from companies that offer a great customer experience.\n  88% of consumers don’t mind paying for faster delivery.\n  81% of professionals say that their companies will mostly or completely compete in the future with others based on their customer experience.\n  Delivery Operations Statistics Last-mile delivery makes up 53% of all delivery operational costs. Organizations with optimized supply chains have 15% lower costs than companies that don’t focus on optimization. Only 4% of companies have an agile organization. 37% of companies have started the process of building an agile delivery. Key initiatives in operational optimization like delivery management platforms can reduce costs up to 20%. The most important last-mile delivery initiative is reducing cost. 51% of supply chains see the lack of clarity on customer demand as the biggest issue stemming from COVID-19. The most common KPI for delivery logistics monitoring is daily performance (40%), closely followed by cost reduction (35%), as well as production service rate (29%) and inventory turn (28%). At 21.1%, visibility is the biggest challenge faced by delivery and supply chain professionals. It is closely followed by factoring consumer demand (19.7%). 48.4% of brick and mortar stores serve as distribution centres or depot locations within their supply chain. 53% of the total transportation cost comes from last-mile delivery. In-store delivery pick-up had a 554% YOY increase in May 2020.  Reverse Logistics 30% of all online deliveries are returned by customers. By contrast, only 8.89% of purchases made in brick-and-mortar stores. That’s 92% of customers say they will continue to do business with a company if the return process is easy. On the other hand, 57% of consumers say returning an item is a complete hassle or the process could be easier. That’s why 62% of customers are willing to shop at your online store if they can return an item at your physical store. 67% of shoppers also check the return policy page before checking out their item and making a purchase. And 58% of shoppers want a no-questions-asked return policy, while 47% expect to see a return label on their purchase. The biggest reason customers cite for returning an item is receiving the wrong item (23%). This is followed by receiving an item that is different from their order (22%) and receiving a damaged item (20%). 79% of customers want free shipping with their return delivery, but only 49% of retail companies offer free return shipping. If you offer them a free return with their purchase, 27% of customers are willing to spend over $1,000. That is why 60% of retail companies consider reverse logistics an important asset of their organization. But only 32% have an effective solution for managing reverse logistics. 40% of US companies report their organizations to produce less waste as a direct result of their reverse logistics operations. 72% of companies admit that they don’t have a suitable platform that can support reverse logistics operations.

Proactively manage operations When the fleet leaves your depot locations, it seems hard to stay on top of plans. And there are a lot of unknowns you can’t factor in, like vehicle breakdowns or traffic congestion.\nClearly, you can’t predict these situations. But you can anticipate incidents.\nIt’s far better to plan for them before they happen than react to them, or, worse - do nothing.\nRoute planning software helps you take a proactive approach to manage delivery operations.\nThe software allows you to monitor your drivers and their progress with GPS tracking to confirm ETAs (expected times of arrival) live.\nBy gaining up-to-the-minute visibility over arrival times, you get real-time updates from the field.\nIn turn, you can build an agile delivery operation with more robust plans that anticipate late deliveries.\nSo when something unexpected occurs, you can act on it at a moment’s notice and tell customers about it. Ensuring customer satisfaction remains intact as you move forward.\n2. Generate more business Consumer expectations are changing. Modern customers want more convenience, speed, and control with each delivery.\nIn fact, when it comes to how fast customers want their orders to arrive, 88% are willing to pay for faster delivery. That’s a big opportunity to generate more business.\nIf you want to provide faster, on-demand delivery, the key is to automate your operations using the software.\nWith an end-to-end cloud-based solution, you can change and support the entire ecosystem. Ultimately, this makes it easier to increase the rate at which you fulfil orders, even when demand exceeds your capacity.\n3. Plan deliveries around orders After an order is delivered, nothing is stopping you from reassigning resources to the next pending order. And the one after that. Or the order that arrives in the meanwhile.\nWithout a tool that automates delivery scheduling, it’s difficult to plan operations on-the-go or at the click of a button.\nBut if you equip your operations with a routing solution, you can reduce the pressure on your staff, as well as remove any customer concerns.\n4. Keep your customers happy Bad experiences drive customers away. According to a report that surveyed 15,000 consumers, 59% will never do business with a company again after two or three negative experiences.\nIt’s imperative to keep your customers happy. And the only way to do that is to create a culture that values customers, provides quality service, and deliveries on a top performance.\nAnd that’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to delivery management software and customer experience.\n5. Complete deliveries on time When you receive an order, you commit to delivering it on time. And if you let customers choose the time of arrival, the pressure is even greater on you to be punctual.\nEfficient routes can get you there. But you can’t do it manually.\nSo, are you manually planning routes? If you are, you risk not making good on promises to customers.\nInstead, you need to automate the process to account for different variables that affect timeliness, such as:\n Day of the week (are the deliveries scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday?) Time of day (are the deliveries scheduled for morning or afternoon?) Time of year (are the deliveries scheduled during a holiday or shopping rush?) Traffic congestion Road works, closures or shutdowns Vehicle speed  6. Raise delivery and shipping accuracy Accuracy is a major concern in delivery.\nSharing order confirmation and tracking links allow customers to verify the information before shipping removes some of those concerns.\nBut it doesn\u0026rsquo;t end there. Your staff has to be in the loop, as well. And you need to provide them with on-demand access to that information.\nTeams can access, check, and verify the information at every stage of the delivery lifecycle. This ensures complete transparency over the entire operation and maintains pinpoint precision in its execution.\n7. Plan deliveries around each vehicle in your fleet. Whether you use an internal vs. external fleet, you plan routes around multiple vehicles. Probably, not all vehicles are the same. At least one vehicle doesn’t have the same capacity or gets the same mileage per gallon as the others.\nUnless you account for all constraints and available resources of your fleet, you\u0026rsquo;re not efficiently planning routes. And it’s hurting your bottom line.\nThat’s why it’s necessary to include the characteristics of every vehicle in the planning process.\nIt ensures all vehicles are running efficiently and at maximum capacity. And you don’t lose any money to idleness.\n8. Locate your drivers instantly. It’s easy to lose track of drivers once they set off for the day. Without delivery management software, all you can do is rely on dispatchers to keep tabs on them.\nThat’s why you need a route planning tool.\nA dashboard that combines GPS tracking and route planning can easily collect location information and status updates on your vehicles in real-time.\nNot to mention it allows you to:\n Register arrival and departure times Verify vehicle location around the clock View estimated times of arrival Compare planned vs. actual time of arrival Collect electronic proof of delivery  9. Rely on a strategy to manage operations. How do you review the operational performance? How do you optimize the efficiency of your fleet?\nIt’s impossible to set benchmarks, calculate key metrics in delivery logistics, or analyze performance without route optimization.\n10. Make any team member a logistics pro. Route planning tools are extremely user-friendly.\nIts design uses advanced UI to make the software familiar to most users.\nSo, anyone on your team can use it to plan and schedule deliveries.\nThe sleek platform also reduces the learning curve. Instead of days or weeks, a user is qualified and ready to plan deliveries within hours.\nAnd all it takes is a push of a button to optimize all the routes in minutes.\n11. Get started straight away. Unlike legacy solutions, most modern routing software is adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics. Software as a solution (SaaS) companies that build them rely on cloud technology to keep the price low and integration speed high.\nMost such solutions use open APIs to integrate it with your system. But most companies offer developer documentation and tech support that makes the process as painless as possible.\n12. Remain organized Depending on the size and shape of your organization, it can also be quite overwhelming to organize delivery.\nManaging day-to-day operations isn’t just about fulfilling orders. You also have to take into account different depot locations, inventory, supply chain networks, and staff shifts.\nNot to mention, you need to keep track of periodic events like regular vehicle maintenance, vacation days, and holidays. A lot of details can slip through your fingers.\nUsing solutions that operate on the cloud helps you make quick changes ahead of schedule.\nSo, you’re always organized and prepared to see the day through.\n13. Increase your bottom line. Route planning software has a near-instant return on investment (ROI). By raising efficiency and reducing operational expenditure, it maximizes how you use and spend your resources.\n14. Makes data available to drivers Most routing solutions have two components. A delivery management dashboard for operations managers and dispatchers to plan and schedule deliveries. And a delivery app for your drivers.\nThe delivery app provides drivers with data about the customer, delivery, schedule, and routes. It also contains features like electronic proof of delivery, which speeds up drop-offs and makes it easier to collect customer feedback.\nThe app also lets drivers communicate with customers directly. A driver can simply tap the phone, draft a message, and let the customer know soon he will arrive at the address.\nAt the same time, the app reduces the driver’s need to talk over the phone while driving.\nDispatchers can use the dashboard to add new information about the delivery, schedule, or customer which automatically updates on the app.\nAnd this impacts the job safety of your drivers, as calling or texting while driving is a major cause of car accidents.\n15. Grow and scale your delivery operations. What does growth mean to you? Maybe, it’s getting more customers. Expanding to new markets. Or hiring more employees.\nWhatever the case, route planning software drives efficiency by automating your operations at scale.\nThis leaves you with more room to focus on delivering quality results, generating more revenue, expanding your reach, or nurturing better customer relationships.\nBut this is just one tactic.\n Here are 12 delivery tactics to grow your operations you can try out.\n 16. Handle pick-ups and returns. Managing a delivery is an active process. Sometimes, things can happen that are beyond your control.\nAn order may arrive at the wrong location. The customer may not be at home. The order may have been mislabeled or damaged along the way.\nMany different things can cause return deliveries. But not every operation is equipped to handle them.\nThanks to GPS tracking, route optimization software gives you complete visibility over the last mile.\nThis makes it easy to handle reverse logistics.\nAll you have to do is find the nearest driver to the drop-off, and add a pick-up to his schedule.\nIf the item is damaged or broken, you can add the replacement item to a vehicle and assign an additional delivery to a driver at your depot site.\n17. Implement same-day delivery. Same-day delivery combines two things: convenience and speed. In fact, these are among the top factors consumers value in delivery.\nAnd the good news is customers don’t mind paying for it. The bad news is it’s a complicated process.\nLuckily, delivery management software with routing capabilities gives you at least two options.\nYou can either pre-plan same-day deliveries and schedule them to drivers who have a later shift. Or, you can plan it on the go, and assign priority deliveries to the best available drivers.\nBut there is so much more to it.\n Here’s a more detailed guide to same-day delivery and delivery management software.\n 18. Gain an edge over your competitors. On-demand delivery and eCommerce have revolutionized delivery.\nThese days, it’s difficult for small businesses not to see major players as competitors. You may think that because of their size, Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Alibaba, and other giants have the upper hand. They don\u0026rsquo;t.\nTechnically, there is a way you can learn how to compete with Amazon delivery and the rest of them. The solution is to use technology.\nWith route planning software, you can stand out with your offer. You can provide customers with free delivery, next-day, or even same-day delivery.\nTogether with better customer service, you can build a delivery that co-exists with big-name brands and even thrives despite them.\n19. Increase route density. How many deliveries do you schedule per route? If the number is too low, you seriously risk reducing your profit margins.\nRoute density is the key factor in dramatically improving the cost-effectiveness of your delivery operations. Simply put, the higher your route density, the less it costs to fulfil an order.\nUsing route planners to optimize routes, lets you increase the number of assignments each driver has on his delivery run. And with more drop-offs, the lower it costs to reach each one.\n***\nNow it’s your turn. Tell us, are you manually planning routes?\nIt’s a simple question. But It’s also extremely simple to get trapped in such a dangerous routine.\nAnd thinking this is how it’s always been done, doesn’t help either. It gets you nowhere with your business nor your customers.\nThink about it for a second. Using a pen and paper to plan routes is time-consuming. It’s inefficient. And it’s making you lose money.\nSo, maybe it’s time to stop and improve your delivery with route optimization software?\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

Offer different delivery options to your customers. Most of the time, people know exactly what they want to get out of their delivery experience. But sometimes, they don’t.\nAnd then, of course, there are those customers that want more no matter how much you provide.\nThe fact is a perfect customer doesn’t exist. And it’s impossible to satisfy everyone who walks through your door. It’s pointless to try and consider it.\nSo, the best thing you can do is give your customers a choice when it comes to how they want you to deliver them their orders.\nThis lets customers take the driver’s seat when choosing their preferred delivery method and eliminates a lot of the pressure associated with satisfying their demands.\nIt’s like going into a restaurant and a customer ordering something off the menu. Most people won’t do it. And those that do often have no problem settling for an item that’s on the menu.\nAfter all, delivery is second place to the primary function of your business: selling a stellar product or service to your customers.\nOffering multiple delivery options eliminates any shipping concerns, like delivery speed, or cost, or location.\nAt the same time, you shouldn’t have too many offers on the table. According to the psychology of choice, people are six times more likely to buy from you if there are only six items on offer.\nSo, try to stay within that margin. Provide customers with options that reflect their typical demands:\n Free delivery Affordable delivery (4-day or 5-day delivery) Standard delivery (2-day delivery) Same-day delivery Local delivery Worldwide delivery Custom delivery  The more options you align with customer preferences the more customers you will attract.\nHow does delivery management software help expand your offer? Delivery management software increases your selection of delivery options because it improves the efficiency of your operations.\nWhen it comes to standard offers like 2-day, 3-day, 4-day, or 5-day delivery, the software lowers cost by raising route density.\nThe more deliveries you have per route, the less it costs to fulfil orders, and the more enticing it is for customers to use your service.\nFree delivery is much harder to achieve.\nBut optimizing delivery routes and schedules can lower cost to an absolute minimum.\nSo, even if you deliver more valuable products for free, the profit margin remains intact.\nAs for speed, there is a clear link between same-day delivery and delivery management software.\nHaving the ability to monitor operations live, lets you schedule deliveries in real-time and assign them to the nearest drivers.\nFinally, the software is extremely flexible.\nYou can customize deliveries individually, and assign them based on size, volume, type of vehicle, capacity, destination, unique driver requirements, and other parameters specific to the customer’s demand.\n2. Enable customers to track their delivery. Not a lot of customers have used delivery to get goods before the outbreak of the coronavirus.\nEven now, that number isn’t much higher. In fact, only 31% of people in the US use third-party delivery services twice a week.\nThat’s because people don’t place too much trust in delivery.\nOutside of Millennials and Gen Z, people still have a psychological imperative to sense things.\nIn other words, they want to feel, smell, touch or see what they buy.\nSensing changes our perception and gives us reassurance about the unknown.\nThat’s why customers want to track the status of their order.\nIf you let customers check the progress of their delivery, you give them the ability to see their order move through space and time.\nAnd this ultimately gives them peace of mind.\nNot only that, but greater visibility means greater control. Customers feel on top of the situation.\nAnd what’s even more important, they don’t feel left out of the process which involves them.\nIt also provides customers with a confirmation.\nThe delivery has started its journey to the specified destination. Now, all they have to do is wait for it to arrive.\nBut any delivery track and trace, especially live tracking, requires you to use advanced technology.\nHow delivery management software enables tracking in real-time? Visibility is a keystone feature of delivery management.\nWithout it, operations managers and dispatchers would remain blind to the dynamics of delivery despite having sophisticated software.\nInstead, delivery management tools use geolocation and GPS positioning and tracking to map each agent in the field (via some device on their person or in the vehicle).\nDispatchers then use the dashboard to assign tasks to each deliverer. Each task represents a delivery and is part of the delivery agent’s route and schedule.\nSegmenting deliveries individually like this is what allows you to focus on specific orders.\nYou can use the platform to isolate a task, create a sharable link, and send it to the customer when you confirm their order.\nThe customer can then track his delivery on the map, and see exactly where it is in the delivery lifecycle.\nAnd the customer has complete oversight of the ETA of his delivery. Based on that information, he can see any major delays that would prevent the delivery from arriving on time.\n3. Let customers pick the arrival date and time of their delivery. Customers want more convenience from each delivery.\nIn fact, it’s among the top three things customers value in a quality experience, according to a survey from 2020.\nYou may think an average customer wants his order delivered fast. But what he wants, even more, is to choose when his delivery arrives.\nLetting customers choose the time and date of the delivery solves a major pain.\nAllowing them to select the most convenient time means they can plan their time hassle-free.\nAnd they no longer have to worry about missing their order when it arrives.\nCustom ETAs remove another concern customers and companies have with home delivery. It minimizes the chance of returns.\nDoing so keeps costs down and maintains a solid customer experience level.\nBut the problem with this is planning and scheduling those deliveries.\nHow does delivery management software let you plan drop-offs around custom times of arrival? It’s a very complicated process to let customers choose the exact time when their delivery will arrive.\nHowever, you can let them choose the time of day when that can happen.\nFor example, you can divide the day into three parts (mornings, afternoons, and evenings). With a 4-5 hour slot for each time of day.\nThen all you have to do is use delivery management software to plan and schedule deliveries around those times.\nThe software also connects with other apps, such as order management systems.\nThis enables it to label each new delivery based on the customer’s preference.\nOnce all of the orders have been created, the dispatcher can drag and drop each task (or use bulk CSV upload) to group them.\nThen it’s up to the system to automatically assign them to among drivers, schedules, and routes.\n4. Send out notifications to customers about their delivery. Even when customers can handpick the time of arrival of the delivery, it doesn’t guarantee they won’t forget about it.\nThat’s why you need to remind them about it.\nSending notifications before the drop-off is a great way to ensure customers never miss a delivery.\nA quick SMS and email reminders 24-hours before arrival or on the selected way is a simple way you can achieve this.\nFor a truly memorable experience, you can send another notification one hour before drop-off.\nBut doing this manually is difficult. So, you will need to find a more efficient solution.\nHow delivery management software automates notifications and alerts? Most modern delivery management systems are SaaS solutions.\nAnd usually, the companies that make them are adopting the cloud-first approach to delivery logistics.\nCloud technology makes the entire tool an open system.\nUsers can manage and customize the various features based on their needs and requirements, like creating automatic notifications.\nYou can then simply go to the notifications panel, edit properties (text and timestamps), and set it as the default version for all delivery tasks.\nYou can also choose to send notifications via SMS, email, or both.\nIn turn, this automates all alerts, so the system sends them according to your parameters without the need for manual interference.\nOf course, you can manually edit the notification for each task. In case it\u0026rsquo;s a special or custom order.\n5. Give drivers the ability to communicate with customers directly. Good communication is the key to customer service. It’s what creates trust between the brand and the customer.\nAnd when it comes to communicating with your customers, it’s not your company that does the talking. It’s your workforce.\nSo, it stands to reason that empowering drivers to talk to your customers is what helps build and nurture quality relationships.\nDespite what you might think, customers don’t get their first impression when they interact with your brand.\nFirst impressions only happen through personal interaction.\nThat starts with your customer service. But not even they get to meet your customers in person.\nThe only people who truly get to talk to your customers are your delivery agents. The people who finish the lifecycle of each delivery at drop-off. The only ones who can really build trust.\nSo, it’s critical to equip drivers with all the tools to establish a good rapport with your customers.\nGiving them the ability to talk to your customers directly before delivery can help you win them over.\nLet’s say a driver has just completed a delivery.\nHe is ready to move to the next address on his route. But before he starts the engine, takes out his phone and checks the information about that next delivery.\nA driver can know who the customer is before he reaches his destination. He can also contact that person via message, and say:\n Hi John,\nYour delivery is 15 minutes away.\nSee you soon!\nMark from delivery\nIt’s that simple.\n But a genuine gesture of care like this can open the door to your customer for your brand.\nAnd once it’s open, it is easy to build a relationship that will retain that customer for a long time.\nHow delivery management software enables drivers to communicate with customers? Most delivery management solutions have two interconnected parts: a dashboard and a phone app.\nThe dashboard is the core of the software.\nRoute planners, operations managers, and dispatch use it to plan and schedule deliveries.\nAnd since it can connect with other apps, all teams can use it to communicate internally with each other.\nThe second component is the delivery app.\nAlso known as the driver app, it’s what lets teams on the ground access relevant data about deliveries and communicate with teams at the office.\nThese types of apps are what your drivers can use to communicate with customers directly.\nAnd it works like most other apps you have on your phone.\nAll you have to do is download it (via Google Play or Apple Store), install it, log in, and it’s ready for use.\nInside, there are limited functions compared to the delivery management platform.\nOn the other hand, it has some features necessary for your drivers.\nAmong those features are: electronic proof of delivery, access to customer data, and basic messaging system drivers can use to talk to customers.\nBesides this, it can also contain questionnaires, delivery forms, ratings, and anything else you might need filling out during drop-off.\nAnd that can be very useful when you want to get to know what customers think about your delivery.\n6. Rely on customer feedback to improve your delivery. Listen to your customers. In any delivery operation, regardless of the industry, this is the key to providing a quality customer experience.\nBe it restaurants, dark kitchens, field service operations, or pharmacy delivery, it’s the best, and usually, the only way to get to know what customers think.\nGathering feedback from customers can tell you a lot about your operations, as well. You can find out:\n What works in your delivery What doesn’t What needs fixing What your delivery lacks And many other suggestions  Collecting this kind of data is critical when you want to create an offer based on actual customer demand.\nBut that also means there will be too much information to process manually at some point. And that’s when technology can step in.\nHow does delivery management software rate let customers leave feedback and rate your service? As mentioned earlier, equipping drivers with delivery apps lets them automate the process of collecting data in the field.\nYou can digitize the entire process using barcodes, QR codes, digital signatures, or any other type of confirmation and proof of successful delivery.\nBut it’s critical when you get feedback, as well.\nPut yourself in your customers’ shoes.\nIt’s not very appealing to stand in front of your door, filling out a questionnaire about your delivery experience. It’s also very time consuming to do by hand.\nIt’s much easier and faster to use technology.\nIt also helps remove a lot of the concerns customers usually have with filling out these kinds of forms.\nAll you have to do is craft a quality customer survey and upload it to the delivery management software.\nWith a delivery app at their side, drivers can collect and store feedback electronically by handing customers their tablets or phones, or sharing it with them over the internet.\nThe speed and easy use make it convenient for customers to tell you what they think about their experience.\nAnd that’s the first step to developing a truly personalized service.\n7. Focus on creating a personalized customer experience. Collecting vital information about customers can shape your delivery. It provides valuable insights into customer requirements.\nAnd one such emerging requirement is personalization.\nCreating a personalized delivery experience for each individual customer is crucial to survival in the age of empowered customers.\nAnd it all starts with “Hello John” and big data.\nBig data is playing a major part in managing delivery operations these days. So much in fact, that it’s among the top delivery management trends.\nProcessing large amounts of data helps you better understand the people that use your delivery.\nIt allows you to get a sense of:\n Who they are; Where they come from; Why they chose you; What do they want in a delivery; What do they value; How do they want their orders to be delivered; And much more.  Finding out this information and using it to build a personal experience allows your delivery to cater to the needs of each customer individually.\nAnd when you create a service around a single person, it makes that person feel special.\nThis automatically raises your chance of attracting and persuading more customers to use your delivery.\nNot to mention, it helps retain them much longer.\nBut processing large amounts of data requires technology.\nAnd delivery management software can help with that, as well.\nHow does delivery management software help create a personalized customer experience? As mentioned, delivery management software uses cloud computing.\nOperating on the cloud makes this type of solution highly flexible and integrates with other systems.\nBut it also makes it capable of merging with other emerging technologies as well.\nThis includes big data.\nProcessing data and combining it with your delivery helps create a personalized experience.\nInitially, this can help you personalize notifications, give drivers access to customer information, or shape the delivery offer.\nBut as you collect more data using the software, you get to know more about the preferences of each customer.\nFrom there, you can start customizing recurring deliveries to fit each individual.\nFor example, you can assign specific drivers to customers that give them five-star ratings.\nYou can learn if the customer prefers the order to arrive at their office or home address. Or how fast they want it to arrive and at what time of the day.\nYou can even stock the vehicles of those drivers with extra products they can upsell to customers on the spot.\n Read our this guide if you want to find out more about upselling and cross-selling with delivery.\n Thanks to delivery management software, you can boost customer experience not just for one customer or all of them, but for all of them individually.\nAnd that’s what providing stellar customer service is all about.\nNow, it’s up to you.\nWhat do you think about delivery management software?\nCan it help you improve customer service?

Start small and build your delivery from there. How far are you willing to drive to fulfil an order? This question has to be at the top of your list as you launch your delivery service.\nNot to mention if you start too small, you risk growth over profitability. And profit margins, if you start too big.\nBasically, the larger the delivery area you have to cover, the larger your market. But, at the same time, the longer it takes to deliver an order.\nSo, the best solution is to start small.\nStart with a delivery area that covers just a 5-kilometre radius. In doing so, you get a sufficient route density despite low initial order volumes.\nNot to mention, you improve the fulfilment speed of your delivery. You can entice customers with next-day or same-day delivery and grow despite big-name competitors like Amazon or Walmart.\nRead this article if you want to learn how to compete with Amazon delivery.\nFrom there, you can always expand your operations down the line. It’s much harder to shrink your operations once you have already settled on an area and started delivering to customers.\n2. Increase the route density of your delivery. How many drop-offs does your delivery agent complete per hour? The answer to this question is your route density.\nSimply put, the higher your route density, the less it costs to fulfil each order.\nAnd it’s simple logic. If you pay a delivery driver £20 an hour, and he makes four drop-offs at that time, you pay £5 per delivery. That’s not very sustainable.\nOn the other hand, if you increase his route density by half so that he fulfils eight orders, your cost per delivery goes down to £2.5. And this dramatically improves the cost-efficiency of your operations.\nNot only do you lower costs, but it also means you don’t have to pass on this cost to your customers. This leaves you more room to create better offers, like free delivery.\nIn doing so, you attract more customers and raise order volumes. Thus, you go full circle, since higher order volumes mean higher route density.\n3. Keep track of your cost per delivery. Cost per delivery is one of the key metrics in delivery logistics. It answers the question: How much does it cost to deliver each order?\nOften, it is also the single most expensive activity of your organization, besides production or product acquisition.\nBut unlike procuring goods for your business, you can improve the cost-efficiency of fulfilment operations. And that’s because there is more than one way to calculate your cost per delivery.\nSpecifically, there are three ways you can do this. You can choose to calculate it based on distance (mile/kilometre), type of delivery (ordered item), or type of vehicle.\nIn each case, you use the selected parameter to divide the total cost of delivery. Usually, this means payroll, fuel consumption, and vehicle maintenance.\nHere’s the formula when calculating cost based on total distance:\nAfter that, you can use these average costs to find opportunities to optimize your operations and reduce cost without affecting output.\n4. Focus on customer convenience and reliability. Convenience is the driving force of modern delivery. And if you want to take advantage of this potential, it’s necessary to shape your offer based on those desires.\nWhen it comes to delivery, customers want speed and reliability above everything else. If you can offer them same-day delivery, they will choose to do business with you.\nAt the same time, if you pledge to offer faster delivery, you have to make good on that promise.\nA bad experience can have a much bigger impact on how customers perceive your brand than five good reviews. So, it’s vital that whatever you offer you make the utmost effort to fulfil it.\n5. Move your product and service offers online. In-store shopping is in decline. In 2020, retail sales dropped by 16.4 per cent and continue to plummet thanks to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nBut if the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus has shown us anything, it’s that consumers want goods delivered at their door.\nSo, it’s vital that you move your offer online, and start selling your products or services from your website as well.\nCreating an online presence opens your business up to new customers. It lets you access a wider audience where more opportunities can emerge to quickly raise your order volume.\nTechnically, this also means expanding your delivery area. But using dedicated delivery providers removes some of that burden.\nContracting a third-party logistics company or courier until you scale operations is a great way to handle more business without too much investment. In fact, that’s what Amazon does even now.\nDespite the disadvantages of outsourcing country-wide delivery to a dedicated provider, the benefits of online sales far outweigh them.\n6. Offer same-day delivery to your customers. Fast delivery is changing the way deliveries work. Same-day delivery combines the convenience of online shopping with near-immediate access to a bricks-and-mortar store.\nIn that sense, it is a great way to increase your consumer base. The bad news is that it isn’t easy to achieve.\nIn fact, not even Amazon can maintain a balance between the cost and profit of their shipping service. But despite this, there are ways you can achieve same-day delivery.\nThe best solution is to put a price on fast fulfilment because customers don’t mind paying for it.\nAs a matter of fact, statistics show that 88% of customers are willing to pay an extra fee if it means they will receive their orders faster.\nAnd that’s good news if you plan to cover a large area. But on the other hand, you can already offer fast delivery at the local last mile.\nLocal rapid fulfilment helps you create a reliable service your nearest customers will use and value.\nBut that also means removing non-essential steps in your operations, so you can reduce delivery cycles and increase the speed of your delivery.\nAnd when it comes to that there is a clear correlation between same-day delivery and delivery management software.\nUsing this kind of technology helps you find wasteful processes and optimize your operations for greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\nIn doing so, you will be able to create a level playing field that allows you to attract customers and grow your business with same-day delivery.\n7. Re-target inactive customers and accounts. If you already have an established delivery, but struggle to maintain regular order volumes to sustain it, it’s worth taking the time to contact your old customers.\nRe-targeting inactive customers is a great way to detect untapped markets.\nReconnecting with them can help you uncover why those old accounts stopped doing business with you in the first place.\nPerhaps, they may have gone to your competitor due to a better deal or the prospect of free delivery. But now things might be different. It’s up to you to find out what it will take for them to switch back to you.\nEven if things don’t work out like that, the feedback you receive is valuable to your efforts to improve customer experience and growing your business.\n8. Use the physical store as your supply depot. Starting an internal vs. external delivery fleet requires several investments. And supply chain infrastructure is just one of many that can push back the launch of your delivery service.\nHowever, you can make use of what you have to reduce those costs. One way is to use your physical store as a supply depot.\nAt the front of your store, it is business as usual. While at the back, your storage facility becomes a depot location where drivers can come to pick-up their next delivery.\nThis also makes it easier to track and monitor inventory levels. Better inventory tracking can increase your order frequency, which reduces the time it takes to sell your stock.\nIt even allows you to stock vehicles with customer favourites so drivers can upsell the best selling products upon drop-off.\nAll of this helps to increase profit. And with more capital at your disposal, it’s easier to invest in infrastructure, equipment, and the workforce which drives the growth of your operation.\n9. Brand your delivery fleet vehicles. Branding is how customers take notice of your business.\nOut of sight is out of mind. But if customers see vans that carry your company logo crisscrossing around town, you are always on their mind.\nThink about delivery. What is the first one that comes to your mind?\nIf you’re like most people, you associate delivery fleets with big-name brands, like Coca-Cola, FedEx, UPS, Domino’s, Amazon, Walmart, and others.\nAnd that’s a big benefit of operating a private fleet. You get to promote your brand for free.\nAnd since you already have all of the potential to promote your brand standing in your parking lot, unleash it and attract more customers. The business it brings can help scale your business in return.\n10. Invest in delivery management software. The emergence of innovative technology is a major disruption in delivery, as in all aspects of a business.\nIn fact, most companies agree that 44% of businesses plan to increase their tech spend in 2020.\nWhen it comes to deliveries the story is similar. More and more companies are investing in new software solutions.\nUnlike previous on-premise or legacy systems exclusive to large companies, modern SaaS solutions are adopting the cloud-first approach to delivery logistics.\nThat makes them much more flexible, affordable (even for small businesses), and with a greater range of capabilities. These usually include some or all of these features:\n Routing and planning Operations management Fleet management Customer experience Insights and analytics.  Technically, using a delivery management platform gives you the functionality of multiple disconnected apps on one system.\nAnd as you scale, you won’t have to invest in another solution. All you might need to do is expand the package you are on, to account for the growth.\nThe software also easily integrates into a broader ecosystem. You can use APIs to connect with complementary solutions like Shopify.\nLikewise, the system can integrate with emerging technologies. For example, some companies are incorporating data processing and AI algorithms to increase visibility and customer service in their last-mile operations.\nAll in all, when you take into account all of the core functionalities and potential future use, this software is a worthwhile investment for any delivery.\n11. Let customers select delivery dates and time windows. Contemporary customers want more control over their deliveries. Not only do they want to choose how fast their orders arrive, but when they arrive, as well.\nThat’s why letting customers choose their preferred delivery date and time window is the mark of great customer experience. And dividing your delivery schedule into two or three slots is the easiest way to do this.\nFor example, you can split deliveries into mornings (9 a.m. - 12 p.m.), afternoons (12 p.m. - 5 p.m.), and evenings (5 p.m. - 9 p.m.).\nGiving customers the option to hand-pick more precise ETAs allows them to plan their day around the drop-off. This significantly lowers the chance (and cost) of missed deliveries and returns.\nThe downside is that you relinquish some control delivery scheduling and route planning. But this is where the final tactic on our list comes into play.\n12. Optimize your delivery routes and drop-offs. How do you manage drop-offs? Are you manually planning routes? Did you know there is an alternative? It’s called route optimization software.\nPlanning routes automatically takes away the burden of manual planning, which is a time-consuming process that isn’t very cost-efficient.\nThe process also usually depends on the work of one person. This is wasteful of your human resources and their time, which could be better spent on, for example, building an agile delivery operation.\nInstead, route optimization software lets you plan multiple routes with multiple drop-off sites in seconds. And since most modern solutions have easy-to-use UI, the learning curve is quite low.\nThat means anyone in your organization can use it to optimize the output performance of the entire operation. Besides this route optimization software helps you:\n Identify most-cost effective routes Reduce total distance for each route Increases the number of drop-offs And more.  After you integrate route optimization into your system, you let customers select the time of delivery (as mentioned), track their delivery in real-time, and provide more accurate ETAs.\nIn doing so, you raise customer satisfaction to a higher standard of quality.\nAnd the best part is that most modern delivery management solutions contain a route planning module.\nSo, you won’t have to invest in two different tools to improve the performance of your delivery.\nNow, it’s all up to you.\nWhat tactic will you use to expand your delivery operation?\nA lot of these tactics are simple decisions and you can implement them straight away.\nBut some of them, like using delivery management software, take time and testing.\nAnd that’s why we let you explore this strategy for yourself right now.\n We have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

The same is true when you sell products online.\nIn this post, you will learn about the 9 biggest delivery challenges eCommerce companies like yours face in 2020.\nNot to mention, we’ll share the tools and tactics that can help you overcome each one effectively.\nPlus, you’ll get a chance to see one tool work in action (and try it out for yourself).\nSo if you want to cut costs, boost customer experience, and maximize the speed and efficiency of your operations, this guide can get you there.\nLet’s jump right in.\n1. Cutting costs of delivery operations. The cost of delivery is a big problem for retail.\nLet’s face it, fuel, vehicle maintenance, payroll, return deliveries, free-shipping, customer service, and other operational expenses can all eat into your profit.\nWhat’s worse, if you don’t find a way to keep those costs down, you can end up passing them on to your customers.\nIn fact, according to one source, the cost of last-mile delivery makes up 53% of all expenses.\nThat’s why reducing the cost of last-mile delivery is among the most important initiatives among retailers in the world today.\nA key solution to this problem is optimization.\nIf you want to cut the cost of delivery, you need to look at ways to increase efficiency.\nAnd you achieve this by reducing the waste of your resources to maximize their use.\nStatistics back up this claim.\nOrganizations with optimized supply chains have 15% lower costs than those that don’t focus on optimization.\nA big part of the solution is how you use technology. For example, you need to ask yourself questions like: Are you manually planning routes?\nIf the answer is yes, you have to look beyond traditional means of managing your delivery operations.\nYou have to seek out tools that automate the process and let you handle tasks automatically and without too much effort.\nOnce you start using technology, you can use it to pinpoint opportunities to optimize for better performance across the supply chain.\nAfter that, it’s all a matter of locating wasteful processes, so you can move beyond them, which ultimately leads to fewer costs to your organization.\n2. Reducing time to delivery. More and more customers want greater convenience from their online shopping experience.\nStrictly speaking, they want immediate access to their purchase without stepping outside of their home.\nIt’s causing eCommerce stores to beat the clock by creating ever-shorter delivery windows.\nIt’s also why most businesses now offer next-day or even same-day delivery.\nAnd if you want to reduce time to delivery so you can offer faster fulfilment, you need to increase the speed of your operations.\nThe solution here is to streamline the delivery process.\nFrom the moment a customer goes to checkout, you have to be ready to source the purchase from your supplier, package it, and load it onto a transport vehicle.\nIn no small part, this comes down to how you organize your delivery.\nFirst, you must simplify the supply chain.\nYou have to consolidate supply vendors so you always have enough stock to meet demand (even when demand exceeds your capacity).\nWhenever possible, try using local or domestic suppliers as this automatically reduces the time it takes to stock up on inventory.\nThis also helps to increase the order frequency while reducing the time it takes you to sell that stock.\nBeyond the supplier, operational agility can help you speed up delivery by speeding up how you plan and execute deliveries on the go.\nAgility makes your teams more decisive so they can carry out swift actions at each stage of the delivery lifecycle.\nIn turn, you can meet new customer and market standards like reducing time to delivery.\n Read this guide if you want to learn how to build an agile delivery operation.\n Like with cost-efficiency, you should also look to technology for a solution when you want to improve the speed of your operations.\nThere is a clear correlation between same-day delivery and delivery management software.\nExploiting it will lead you to greater speed and more convenience for your customers.\nAnd when customers find your service convenient, they won’t mind paying for it (whatever the price you charge).\n3. Choosing a delivery rate for your company. Deciding on your delivery rate is a question of balance.\nIn this case, the balance between profit and customer happiness.\nIf the delivery fee is too low, you risk mounting operational costs you won’t be able to support.\nYou will generate more expenses over profit, and end up paying for each drop-off out of your pocket.\nIf you set the price too high, you risk disappointing customers and chasing them away. Most likely, to your competitors.\nThe solution is to set your delivery rate manually (if you are handling the fulfilment process yourself).\nAnd while there are a few different methods to calculate how much to charge for delivery, you should take into account basic factors into the fee, like:\n Weight of delivery Distance to drop-off Order size Number of products delivered  One way to calculate the delivery fee is to measure the average order weight of delivery based on the size of your catalogue, the number of products, and order size.\nHere is a quick formula:\nIf you are yet to receive the first order, it’s a safe bet to base the delivery fee on the average order weight.\nBut it isn’t the only solution.\nAnother way to price your delivery is to create different delivery zones.\nAll you have to do is offer different rates to customers living in different geographical areas.\nFor example, you might offer the most affordable rates to customers that are the nearest to your supply chain (1.5-3 miles), and raise it as you move away.\nThis is especially useful when you sell products nationwide or internationally, or when you want to invite consumers in your area to use a local delivery service.\nOn the other hand, you can leave the fulfilment rate entirely up to your third-party delivery logistics provider to determine.\n4. Building a private fleet or outsourcing to a delivery provider. Technically, there are two ways you can go about delivering products to your customers.\nThe first is to create an internal fleet and fulfil the orders yourself.\nThe second is to outsource the delivery to a third-party provider.\nWhile eCommerce stores use both models, it’s entirely up to you to choose which one works best for your business.\nBut, there are certain benefits to using each solution.\nWhen it comes to using a third party delivery operator (or dedicated courier service), the biggest advantage is that you don’t need large capital investment to get started.\nIt also means you don’t cover the operational cost of the delivery fleet.\nBesides that, outsourcing fulfilment also gives you:\n Faster integration of the delivery system in eCommerce Greater access to contacts, tools, and resources More time to focus on core activities More flexibility in terms of cost and spending Less risk and liability to your brand.  But the biggest downside to using dedicated providers is that it erodes your margins over time.\nBecause you have to cover the service fee (per delivery, per vehicle, monthly or annual), you have less control over how you price products.\nUsually, this makes you less competitive.\nOn the other hand, you can build your own delivery fleet.\nUsing a dedicated delivery fleet gives you back control over the price of your products (including delivery fees).\nIt allows you to offer free delivery or same-day delivery without losing service quality, which is useful in an age where you have to know how to compete with Amazon delivery, Walmart, Alibaba, or eBay.\nLikewise, it also provides other benefits which might make it enticing for you, such as:\n Complete control over operations Flexibility to handle unexpected deliveries More room to focus on customer service Higher quality of service Greater brand recognition.  But all of these benefits come at a cost.\nCrucially, you need high initial capital investment to set up a private fleet before you can start delivering products to customers.\nHere’s a complete guide about the advantages (and disadvantages) of operating an internal vs external delivery fleet, if you want to know more.\n5. Increasing the transparency of your delivery service. Customers want a dependable service they can count on.\nIf you say you are going to deliver their purchase by a certain time and date, they expect you to keep your word.\nBut things don’t always happen the way you plan.\nDelays, unexpected circumstances, and other disruptions to your delivery schedule can happen without notice.\nIn these situations, you need to keep customers in the loop about their delivery and be transparent about it.\nThe ideal solution is to give customers the ability to track their deliveries in real-time.\nUsing eCommerce delivery management software allows you to share a map with the current location of the customer’s order for 100% transparency and ETA accuracy.\nA simpler solution is to let customers pick the time and date when they want their delivery to arrive.\nAnd it doesn’t even need to be too specific.\nAll you have to do is give customers a few options for the time of arrival at checkout.\nFor example, the ability to choose between morning, afternoon, and evening deliveries.\nGiving them the control to choose the time of arrival means you avoid the complications when dropping off their order while maintaining a suitable level of transparency.\n6. Handling return deliveries and lost or damaged orders. Operating a delivery service is an active process.\nSometimes things may occur that are beyond your control.\nAn order may be mislabeled and arrive at the wrong address.\nIt may arrive damaged or broken.\nOr the customer may have ordered the wrong item and wants to return it.\nDon’t worry.\nThese situations can happen and do happen to everyone.\nHow you deal with them is what matters more to your customers and greatly impacts how they see your brand.\nThe solution is to have an operation that can handle forward delivery, just as easily as reverse logistics.\nIf you don’t know what reverse logistics is, simply put it’s the control of the movement of return items back to your store, warehouse, or supply depot. For this, you need to have three things:\n A good customer support team that can receive return orders, find quick solutions, and maintain happiness; An inventory management system that lets you quickly find a replacement item at the nearest depot location or storage facility, and; A delivery management system that lets you track and trace drivers you can dispatch in real-time to make the necessary pick-ups and drop-offs.  Taking care of returns quickly like this is a good business practice.\nIt helps you save money (you can exchange return items for cash faster) and removes much of the customers’ frustration.\nAnother way to protect your organization is to purchase insurance.\nThis ensures you don’t lose money on lost or damaged deliveries, especially on more valuable deliveries.\nIf you are using a dedicated provider, the process is much simpler.\nAll you have to do is settle on a service fee since the rate for return deliveries is different from regular drop-offs.\nBut keep in mind that delivery providers usually can’t provide the same quality of service you want to deliver to your customers.\nAnd when things go wrong, providing the best possible customer service is exactly what you need to focus on.\n7. Maintaining quality control and customer experience. Customer service is an important part of the delivery experience.\nYou have to maintain a high level of quality from the moment a customer lands on your website down to the moment when their purchase arrives at their door.\nAnd customers agree with that.\nIn fact, 90% of people in the US cite customer service as a factor that drives their decisions.\nThe best way to achieve that level of satisfaction is to build and nurture relationships with your customers.\nAccording to an essay by business guru Kevin Kelly, 1000 true fans is all you need to succeed in business.\nAnd maintaining true relationships is the cornerstone of that mantra.\nWe’ve already mentioned several ways you can do that.\nLetting customers choose the time of arrival and making return deliveries as painless as possible are good starting points.\nBeyond that, you need to create a culture in your organization that puts a lot of emphasis on customer service.\nAll your teams have to be aware of this.\nFrom dispatchers down to drivers and field agents, everyone has to be on board with this decision.\nAnd technology can help you out here as well.\nEquipping your teams with delivery apps lets them communicate with customers directly. In doing so, you also promote customer-employee interaction.\nImagine how a customer feels when he receives a direct message from a driver saying that he’s fifteen minutes away from their address.\nAnd when a customer knows their delivery is arriving they can prepare for the handoff.\nIt leaves more room for drivers to talk to your customers person-to-person, rather than “Hello. Sign here. Goodbye.”\nBut for a truly great experience, you need to go to even greater lengths. And this requires listening to your customers and finding out what they want.\n8. Capturing data and acting on customer feedback. Data is taking over business.\nAs more and more customers look for a personalized experience with every purchase, big data is letting businesses create those experiences for them.\nThe same is true for delivery.\nCollecting data during delivery is a great way to get to know what your customers think about the service before they have something to say.\nIt gives you a window into their behaviour, preferences, needs, and desires.\nThe final result is a personalized delivery experience that customers will adore.\nCustomer data also opens up new possibilities.\nIt allows you to anticipate customer needs, as well as demand.\nYou can start adding a personal touch to each delivery.\nYou can even stock your vehicles with customer favourites and let delivery agents upsell them during drop-off.\n Learn more about upselling and cross-selling with delivery.\n If data processing might seem a bit beyond your reach at the moment, another way to improve your delivery is to ask for feedback.\nCustomers are always eager to give you a piece of their mind, especially if they have had a bad experience.\nThe best part is that all you have to do is listen to what they say.\nDon’t look at it as a tarnish on your reputation. Instead, try to see it as an opportunity to give them what they want.\nUse customer feedback to evaluate your operations, and see what’s working and what isn’t.\nAt some point, you will fix what’s wrong, add what’s missing, and improve upon what you are doing right.\nAs you do, customers will start noticing it and associate your brand with amazing delivery.\n9. Integrating different software solutions. Automation is practically second nature for most eCommerce companies.\nIf there is a digital solution to a problem, you are probably using it.\nNot to mention there are also a lot of platforms where you sell your products, like your website, social media, Amazon, or Shopify accounts.\nBut receiving orders from multiple sides and using various disconnected apps to manage them isn’t what you had in mind when you set out to automate your delivery operations.\nThe solution to your problem is delivery management software.\nThis type of software takes care of your delivery end-to-end.\nYou can use it to receive orders and schedule deliveries, as well as increase efficiency by optimizing your routes or customer service.\nWhat’s best about this solution is that it can integrate with sales platforms or order management systems via APIs (Application Programming Interface).\nIf you have a Shopify account, for example, and connect it to a delivery management solution, you can manage all the deliveries from one dashboard as soon as a customer checks out.\nFrom there, you can schedule the delivery, assign a driver, map out their routes, and even do it all in real-time.\nBest of all you can do it with several different apps, including inventory monitoring or customer service.\nNow, it’s your turn.\nWhat’s the biggest challenge to your delivery? What solution do you think will work best for your store?\nYou may have noticed that technology is the ideal tool that lets you work out most of these challenges without too much hassle.\nAnd when it comes to eCommerce delivery management, we think the easiest way to manage it is by using delivery management software.\nBut we can help.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

And at the end, you will get a chance to try out one solution straight away.\nSo, if you want to get the best route optimization software for your business, this guide is for you.\nLet’s get started.\nWhat is route optimization software? Route optimization software is a tool for planning routes automatically. It helps you plan the best routes by mapping multiple delivery stops for all of your drivers or vehicles in all of your delivery fleets.\nBut it’s not just used for reaching point B from point A. Route optimization software lets you plan multiple routes that have multiple drop-off or pick-up destinations.\nThe tool is designed for managing field service, delivery, and logistics operations.\nAnd managers and planners use it to improve the speed and efficiency of those services.\nIn short: Route optimization lets you create the most efficient routes in seconds for all of the locations your drivers need to reach.\nHow does route optimization work? The best route optimization tools are mainly used to plan and map out routes to drop-off locations.\nYou can also use a route planner to create tasks (order deliveries). But keep in mind that there is a difference between route planning and route optimization.\nYou can do this either manually by uploading tasks one by one, in bulk via CSV files, or using an API to automatically connect it to an order management system.\nModern routing tools let you create driver profiles. You can use these driver management capabilities to create routes that match task requirements based on the driver’s vehicle, skill, vicinity, or relationship with the customer.\nWhen you’re done planning the routes (and schedules), drivers automatically receive them via the Driver App.\nBut that doesn’t mean you can’t change them in real-time. A drag-and-drop option lets you arrange and rearrange tasks while the system automatically adjusts the routes for maximum efficiency.\nIt lets you access detailed information about each route at any given time. That includes ETAs, service, and waiting time for each task, total route distance, time, and vehicle capacity usage.\nWhen it comes to your supply chain, you can use the software for single or multi-depot planning. So you can add as many sites as you want.\nAnd you can do this for your entire fleet regardless of its size. The tool easily supports five or a hundred vehicles, as well as multiple fleets regardless of whether you have an internal vs. external delivery fleet.\nOnce everything is in place the entire route planning process takes minutes to complete (depending on how many vehicles and tasks you have).\nThe system lets you store information about previous tasks, schedules, and routes. So, you can easily retrieve recurring routes.\nTechnically, you can also use it to track and monitor live operations in real-time.\nBut it also allows you to set fixed routes based on predetermined collections or delivery orders.\nOver time, this feature-rich environment has outgrown its initial purpose. In most cases, today route optimization is just one suite in an end-to-end solution known as the delivery route optimization software.\nDespite all of these capabilities, many organizations continue to rely on pen and paper to plan their delivery or service routes.\nWhat’s wrong with manual route planning? Are you still manually planning routes?\nIf you are, there are a lot of areas you are losing valuable resources.\nFirst, you are probably highly dependent on one person who has a working knowledge of geography where your distribution takes place.\nIf that person leaves, the entire operation can quickly fall apart. It’s even worse if it’s a team of people.\nIt’s also wasteful. There is a lot of untapped potential among your staff that can better serve another area of your organization, like building an agile delivery operation.\nSo instead of building a flexible operation, you end up relying on fixed routes.\nThat makes it difficult to assign the best drivers or vehicles to specific tasks (vehicle management), and you miss out on opportunities to optimize and scale.\nThat leaves you with no room for real-time planning, so you can’t speed up the process.\nSeeing how same-day and next-day delivery matters so much to your customers, you lose a competitive advantage without faster operations.\nEven if you have been planning routes manually for a long time (and it works), it’s what’s holding back your business.\nWhat are the benefits of route optimization tools? Regardless of what route optimization software you choose, there are at least ten ways they can benefit your operations:\n#1 It helps you identify the most cost-effective routes. This is the main feature of route planning software. It relies on advanced algorithms to analyze and determine the best routes based on your parameters.\n#2 It reduces the total distance for each route. Routing software determines driving distance based on the availability of your drivers and vehicles, not to mention tasks and schedule constraints.\nIt analyzes available resources to create routes that reduce drive time, improve key metrics in delivery logistics, and save money by reducing:\n Fuel costs Time spent on the road Vehicle wear-and-tear Vehicle maintenance costs Traffic exposure Safety risks Insurance and liability costs  #3 It improves responsiveness. Quick dispatching (for same-day or next-day delivery), impromptu orders, or longer service times require fast rescheduling.\nRoute optimization tools let dispatchers create orders live, and easily assign them in real-time.\n#4 It raises customer satisfaction. Convenience, speed, and reliability are key factors customers use to determine the quality of your delivery. But they also want a human touch.\nCreating driver profiles using delivery route management software lets you match the right driver with the right customer.\nThe Driver app ensures the best on-time arrival rates by allowing drivers to communicate with customers directly.\nNot to mention, it helps nurture customer relationships and loyalty which reduces service windows without affecting the quality of customer service.\n#5 It increases the number of tasks you can complete each day. Because the software lets you dispatch orders in real-time, drivers can complete more tasks during their runs.\nIt also maintains workforce happiness, since any additional drop-offs or last-minute changes have the least travel distance.\n#6 It maximizes the use of your fleet capacity. A route optimization tool gives you greater insight into the capacity of each vehicle in your fleet.\nThis helps you maximize output per vehicle by reducing idle cargo space, as well as maintain operational effectiveness when demand for delivery exceeds your capacities.\n#7 It minimizes delays en route. Reducing the number of minutes your drivers spend in traffic has a significant impact on the cost of your operations.\nIn fact, a recent survey found that productivity loss due to traffic congestion in 2018 was $87 billion.\nRoute optimization tools let planners adjust routes based on incoming information from the field, which cuts costs and saves time spent on the road.\n#8 It boosts the happiness of your workforce. Planning routes automatically removes a lot of the pressure from your teams.\nOn the one hand, this benefits the dispatcher.\nAs they spend less time planning routes, they can dedicate themselves to driving better results elsewhere.\nOn the other, drivers feel less frustrated.\nPlanners can easily create multi-drop routes for drivers based on their preferences, or round trips with tight drop-offs and suitable break times.\nAnd since the software automatically tracks progress and updates it across the delivery management platform, there is less unnecessary communication between teams.\n#9 It lets you optimize your fleet. Optimizing routes helps you discover waste in your operations.\nIt lets you reassess the size of your fleet with greater precision, so you can right-size the number of vehicles.\nAnd fewer vans or trucks mean fewer field operators, less fuel, less equipment, and less maintenance.\n#10 It raises the output and performance quality of your team. Tracking and tracing the progress of the workforce lets you assess their output.\nThis can help you identify inefficiencies in the process, as well as your workforce, and optimize before it hinders your operations.\nHow much does route optimization cost? The average starting cost of route optimization software is around $20 per vehicle. But this price depends on a few factors.\nFirst, it depends on whether you just want route optimization, or do you want to invest in a more robust system and choose delivery management software.\nThen it depends on whether you want to choose an on-premise solution or adopt a cloud-first approach to managing delivery logistics.\nOn-premise solutions typically cost more and require an upfront payment.\nYou pay for a perpetual license or sanctioned copy of the software, but not the necessary infrastructure that supports it.\nCompanies like Paragon, Descartes, and Trimble TMW offer these solutions.\nSaaS solutions are less expensive.\nInstead of buying to own the software, you (usually) pay an annual monthly fee to use it.\nBut the provider supplies the supporting infrastructure, so there are no additional costs.\nIt’s an operating expense rather than a capital expense (Opex vs. Capex).\nThe cost also depends on the size of your fleet.\nSome SaaS companies set the price per vehicle per month.\nCompanies like Maxoptra, Routific, and Optimoroute use this method.\nAnd it depends on the features you want and the complexity of your operations.\nCompanies like eLogii, Onfleet, and Tookan use this payment model.\nToday, most companies choose SaaS over on-premise legacy solutions. And tend to pay for features rather than the number of vehicles they operate.\n This post explains everything about delivery management software cost.\n Is route optimization better than delivery management software? Yes, but only if you need additional features and capabilities to manage your operations.\nUsing just route optimization software works best for small businesses.\nThose companies that neither have a big fleet nor require additional capabilities, such as reverse logistics.\nHowever, this doesn’t mean you won’t scale your operations at some point.\nAnd delivery management software has the upper hand here.\nWhether you want to achieve an uninterrupted pharmacy delivery, a way to manage field service operations, or a better way to optimize food delivery in your restaurant, it has you covered.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what other companies can use the platform:\n Third-party logistics (3PL) Grocery and food distributors Beverage distributors eCommerce and retailers Healthcare Construction Dark kitchens and food delivery And more  Strictly speaking, it’s an end-to-end solution that is well-suited to any task or industry or size of the organization.\nPlus, that makes it more cost-effective once you grow.\nSaaS companies with flexible options that let you pick and choose the capabilities you want to use with pay-as-you-go payment plans.\nWhat’s more, for a slightly higher price you get a feature-rich environment that can serve you for many years.\nAnd because of that, we offer a trial version for our delivery management software.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

Plus, we’ll throw in a super useful hint that you can try out straight away.\n(But more on that later)\nRight now, if you want to get more out of your delivery, agility will get you there. And this article will help you get started.\nSo without any more delays, let’s jump in.\nWhat is an agile delivery operation? An agile delivery operation is a modern approach to delivery.\nIt lets you adapt to change, and improve the speed and efficiency of your activities even at scale.\nThis kind of strategy gives you the ability to:\n Deliver products or services faster than before; Divert resources in line with demand; Plan deliveries on the go and in real-time; Increase output and performance (including key metrics in delivery logistics); Meet new customer and market standards; Gain a competitive edge.  Creating an agile delivery also lets you react to the reality of day-to-day delivery management.\nDoing so makes it possible to cut costs while maximizing the bottom line.\nAdopting this strategy to your delivery planning right now enables you to build an agile delivery early on, and drive agility at scale once you grow.\nBut this doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen overnight.\nSo, before you can do that, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at what it means to be agile.\nWhat makes a delivery agile? Achieving agility is a complex undertaking. There is a lot that goes into it.\nIn fact, a research survey suggests there are no less than five dimensions to agility:\n Alertness or the ability to discover market changes, opportunities, and risks. It lets you observe different stages of the delivery operation, identify trends or disruptions, and respond to them accordingly. Accessibility or the ability to access relevant information that lets you make effective decisions. It requires you to connect the entire supply chain to the same channel of communication so that data can freely flow up and down the delivery network in real-time. Decisiveness or the ability to make firm decisions based on the information at hand. Decisive decision-making at each stage of the delivery lifecycle cuts the time it takes to act on incoming data. It also lets each of your teams make the best call for maximum benefit to your organization. Speed or the ability to quickly carry out decisions and actions based on data or changing conditions. Without swift action, all your other efforts to create an agile delivery operation fall short. Flexibility or the ability to adjust intentions and operations and adjust them to the general strategy. Keep in mind that your delivery is only as flexible as your capacities allow it. When demand exceeds your capacity, for example, it’s time to scale your operations rather than push them over their breaking point.  But that’s not all.\nPlanning your strategy around these five dimensions is just the first step to obtaining agility.\nThere are still a few more steps you will need to take.\nHow to build an agile delivery operation? Agile transformation touches every part of delivery operations.\nAnd that means centring a strategy around the structure, process, people, and technology in your company.\nOne doesn’t work without the others.\nBut once you reach this goal, agile delivery allows you to adjust the entire operation to your actions and decisions.\nAnd let you take full advantage of opportunities that create value for the service.\nHere’s a breakdown of what you need to do for each element of your delivery:\n#1 Structure  Commit to a mission-oriented approach to structure. Put the needs of your operations ahead of your goals. Evaluate locations in your supply chain. Select the best sites and change those that don’t fit the area your operations cover. Evaluate and rightsize your workforce. Build roles and responsibilities that minimize office input and streamline decision making. Simplify the reporting structure. Make it easier for your staff to report progress and performance during day-to-day operations.  #2 Process  Look at ways to free up time for your teams. Give them space to focus some of their attention on tasks that create value. Link different processes to enable collaboration. Create methods that allow you to distribute resources between functions and teams. Center the planning and decision-making processes around quick trials and tests. Even the best laid out plans fail, but you can also improve on your mistakes. Manage performance based on the outcome. Develop results-driven processes rather than those that focus on activities.  #3 People  Develop models that promote positive leadership. Train operations managers and team leaders to coach and inspire their staff rather than direct or instruct them. Seek out and retain the best talent in your company. Reward good performance and provide opportunities based on merit. Nurture a culture that challenges the status quo. Allow everyone to provide insight into how you can optimize your delivery operations. Build informal networks of communication. Let employees form connections among themselves and between teams and customers organically.  #4 Technology  Leverage technology to support your structure, process, and people. Make sure you have the right tools to build an agile delivery operation. Choose tools and software based on actual needs. Learn how to choose a solution that works for your delivery system. Build an infrastructure that allows you to scale your operations. Invest in software that is flexible and allows you to support your delivery now and in the future. Use technology to improve and optimize for better performance. Automate your operations and integrate solutions that enable fast and uninterrupted delivery, like route optimization.  How to start the agile transformation of your delivery operation? There is no right or wrong path to operational agility.\nSome companies develop agile deliveries from the start.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t deployed your delivery yet, take the time to evaluate how agile your strategy is.\nThat makes it easier to quickly scale your service as you grow.\nOn the other hand, if you already have a working delivery, you have to adapt and adjust it to develop an agile environment.\nAnd there are three ways you can go about this:\nFirst, you can take the “all-in” approach to agile transformation.\nThis requires you to invest a lot of resources to organization-wide commitment, so you can deploy every stage all at once.\nThen, there is the step-by-step approach.\nThis is more systematic and lets you build an agile operation one stage at a time.\nFinally, you can initiate the transformation from the bottom-up.\nThis is an emergent approach that is more informal and relies on the efforts of each person in your organization to succeed.\nAfter you deploy the process of transformation (using any of these methods), you will quickly see how it will improve your delivery.\nWhy do you need an agile delivery operation? Agile transformation is on the rise. It’s taking place as we speak across various industries and environments.\nAnd most companies understand this.\nWhether you want to achieve an uninterrupted pharmacy delivery or improve food delivery for your restaurant, agile operations can get you there.\nBut it is not an easy task to achieve.\nAccording to McKinsey, only 4% of companies have an agile organization.\nHowever, the same survey suggests that there are another 37% of companies that have started the process.\nSo, it’s the right time to get into the game.\nAnd whatever your industry, the landscape is demanding transformation.\nYou need an agile delivery operation because of four reasons:\n Changing consumer behaviour Increasing competition Relevance of data Disruptive technology  When it comes to consumers, all of them want fast and convenient delivery.\nThat means creating a customer-centric culture that focuses on experience and service.\nFor example, same-day delivery matters so much to customers in 2020.\nAnd agile delivery is the only way your operation can achieve those speeds.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also a good starting point to learn how to compete with Amazon delivery or anyone else in the modern competitive landscape.\nHave you noticed that there are more companies that offer similar products and services like you?\nThat’s because the market has lower entry barriers than ever before.\nEmerging companies can offer new solutions to old customer pains at the fraction of the cost it took you to launch your business.\nIn part, this is thanks to one of the newest delivery management trends - data processing.\nCompanies can now collect, access, and use massive amounts of data about their customers.\nThat lets them create and customize personalized offers.\nSo for example, they can drive the price of delivery down and immediately impact your bottom line.\nBut this wouldn’t be possible without the emergence of disruptive technologies.\nLegacy solutions for optimizing delivery operations are now obsolete.\nThey have been replaced by flexible solutions that support agility, like delivery management software.\nThese systems are also more available than before.\nSaaS companies are adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics with increasingly more feature-rich environments.\nAt a more affordable price, your company can now gain access to single vs multi-depot planning, route optimization, or electronic proof of delivery all through a single platform.\nBut so can your competitors.\nAnd that means it’s no longer enough to have the best offer, data, or tools.\nYou also need the agility to integrate all of that effectively.\nSo, if you are looking to stay ahead of the game, it’s time for an agile transformation of your delivery operations.\nIt’s the best option for your business. The rewards of an agile delivery operation are real.\nBut to reach them will take no small amount of forward-thinking.\nThat’s why it’s important to understand the forces driving agility, commit to it, and integrate technology that helps you reach that goal.\nAnd when it comes to tech, we did the math.\nCurrently, the best choice on the market is delivery management software.\nAnd we can help you with that.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

And the consequences if something doesn’t change.\nIn this article, we’ll show you the importance of uninterrupted pharmacy delivery and how to reach that goal.\nWe’ll also reveal a solution that can help you overcome all of the challenges of managing pharmacy delivery.\n(But more on that later)\nRight now, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the first step that you need to take.\nMove your storefront online. If the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus has shown us anything, it’s that there is a genuine need for a contactless purchase of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.\nPharmacies have to allow customers to buy and refill prescription medication without stepping foot outside of their homes.\nAfter all, it’s the only way social distancing is going to work.\nBut this disruption in the pharma industry had started even before the spread of the virus.\nIn fact, companies like Capsule had started offering consumers a chance to order their medicine online with same-day delivery in New York as early as 2016.\nThe initial success of the start-up prompted titans like Walgreens and CVS to establish online platforms, as well.\nWhile Amazon entered the market with the acquisition of PillPack.\nStill, customers remained reluctant to order a valuable commodity like prescription drugs online.\nThat’s why before 2020, only 1% of the total $275 billion in revenue that Pharmacy generates came from an online purchase.\nBut the trend is changing in favour of ePharmacy.\nNow, if you want to know how to compete with Amazon delivery, Walgreens, CVS, and the likes, moving your storefront online is a key step in the process.\nIt’s also what your customers want.\nCustomers want the convenience of online shopping with immediate access to the purchase via a pharmacy delivery service.\nAnd that’s exactly what you need to do next.\nOffer pharmacy delivery to your customers. Pharmacy delivery isn’t a new concept.\nCommunity pharmacies and other small independent pharmacies have offered home delivery of medicine for as long as pharmacies have existed.\nYou too have probably delivered prescription medication to a loyal customer who is old or disabled at some point in time.\nBut by modern standards, this was only a small portion of the market.\nThese days, pharmacy delivery is the norm, and demand for it is growing at a rapid pace.\nSo much, in fact, that those same small independent pharmacies are finding it difficult to offer fast on-demand delivery with their existing business process.\n Here’s a quick guide if you want to know how to improve last-mile delivery when demand exceeds your capacity\n And let’s face it, delivery isn’t a cheap operation.\nSo, the question comes to mind: is pharmacy delivery profitable?\nThe answer is YES, absolutely.\nLike in retail or food delivery, your customers want convenience from their shopping experience.\nAnd while it was easier for them to adopt home delivery of clothes and meals, the COVID-19 situation is helping consumers realize the same is true when it comes to their medicine.\nFor many consumers, online pharmacy delivery is fast-becoming as convenient as any other purchase delivery if not more so, especially when compared to visiting a brick-and-mortar store.\nAnd statistics forecasts support this. By 2026, the global ePharmacy market size will grow to over $177 billion with a CAGR of 17.2%.\nAnd if measures to stop the coronavirus pandemic as social distancing persist, pharmacy delivery will remain the only way you will be able to reach your customers.\nThat’s why it’s important to pay attention to what your customers want to get out of doing business with you.\nFocus on customers remains important. The pharma industry has always been consumer-centric.\nChanging consumer behaviour is making it easier for small independent pharmacies to compete, despite the pressure from large enterprises.\nFirst, consumers want choice when it comes to sourcing medicine.\nMost people want to decide (with the help of their doctors) what type of medication they want to consume.\nThis is prompting consumers to turn away from generic or brand-name drugs to more quality products.\nPharmacies that can offer them will have the upper hand over their competitors.\nIn most cases, that means you can dedicate a lot more time and resources to provide a higher level of care.\nIt also means you can create high-trust relationships with your customers, making your services much more reliable (including pharmacy delivery).\nNot to mention, this lets you anticipate the requirements of consumers.\nFor example, it lets you track and control inventory by aligning it to the supply chain.\nThat is becoming increasingly important when you want to maintain a reliable service, especially after the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.\nYou can also listen to your customers' pains and desires much easier than larger suppliers.\nYou can survey customers and incorporate services that customers truly want, such as ePharmacy platforms and home delivery.\nAnd when it comes to pharmacy delivery, it’s a fantastic opportunity to grow your business.\nThat said, creating and maintaining a profitable delivery isn’t an easy task, and it doesn’t come without its challenges.\nUnderstand the difficulties of managing pharmacy delivery. The sudden spike in demand for pharmacy delivery is putting pressure on companies to introduce it as part of their service.\nWhile it’s a great opportunity to generate revenue, you and I know it’s much more difficult than that.\nTo truly succeed, you will need to understand that pharmacy delivery depends on:\n Speed: Delivering medicine has to be fast. Significant delays can have major consequences on your customers’ health; Order allocation: A lot depends on your ability to ensure your customers receive the right brand of medicine, on the right day, and according to their doctor’s prescription; Inventory monitoring: Keeping track of inventory (to maintain stock) is a complex process that requires diligence in how you manage your supply chain. But it’s necessary if you want a reliable delivery service; Supply chain visibility: the complexity of supply chains in the pharma industry means you have to maintain control over how you source and deliver medicine across the entire network; Delivery transparency: both you and your customers have to know the location of every single delivery at any given moment to ensure a seamless transition from pick-up to drop-off; Delivery accuracy: Inaccurate delivery prevents you from providing a reliable delivery service. It also has a negative impact on customer satisfaction, as well as your cost-to-revenue balance; Communication: How well you can communicate with your delivery team and with customers, determines the success of each drop-off. You have to create a seamless flow of data internally, yet extend the line of communication between delivery agents and customers; Measuring key metrics in delivery logistics: Tracking and monitoring the performance of your delivery is vital if you want to maintain efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The only way to do that is to analyze key performance indicators of delivery logistics; Reverse logistics: Despite your best efforts, mistakes can still happen. Creating a fast and agile system that can overcome those issues will help you keep costs low and customer experience high.   Learn how to turn failure into opportunity with reverse logistics\n If you overcome each of these challenges (and raise your delivery operations to another level), you will need to turn to technology for the answer.\nDelivery management software is the solution to optimize pharmacy delivery. Delivery management software is revolutionizing delivery across industries.\nFrom retail to food delivery for restaurants, it is helping businesses realize their goals and those of their customers.\nBesides being among the top delivery management trends for 2020, it is an increasingly important tool in last-mile delivery.\nNot only that, but it can help you increase the status of your pharmacy delivery service.\nFor example, it can help you offer next-day or same-day delivery which matters so much to customers.\nDeciding what type of software best fits your pharmacy isn’t easy.\nBut we can help.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

Delivery is changing the way we consume our food.\nAnd it isn’t a new concept.\nFrom making a phone call to ordering food online from your favourite restaurant, meal delivery has enabled us to get meals brought straight to our doorstep.\nNow, we can even do it by tapping an app on our phone. It’s as simple as that.\nBut this is causing a lot of disruption in the food industry.\nBricks-and-mortar restaurants that were once reluctant to offer delivery as part of their service now accept the fact that it is the way of the future.\nAnd they are not alone anymore.\nFood delivery has also enabled a completely new business model to emerge - dark kitchens.\nTogether with dedicated food-delivery platforms, it is causing a gastronomic revolution and changing the status quo.\nBut as food delivery becomes a necessity in the industry, both standard restaurants, and dark kitchens have to turn to technology to maintain their presence in this dynamic market.\nEnter food delivery management software.\nAn innovative solution for the food delivery supply chain that can help businesses on both sides of the isle achieve their goals.\n(But more on that later)\nRight now, let’s see what is driving this change.\nConsumers are reshaping the food delivery landscape. When it comes to their meals, consumers want it delivered to their doorstep now more than ever.\nIn fact, statistics say there are 1,231.9 million food delivery users in the world in 2020. And this trend is only going to continue.\nAs more millennials come of age and factors like the outbreak of the coronavirus prompt more people to use delivery, that number will swell.\nThe current 25% year-over-year growth of the food delivery industry supports this claim.\nAs does the revenue forecast for 2024, which states the market will rise to over $182 billion.\nAnd the reason behind this growth is convenience.\nThat’s why more and more consumers are using their apps to order food.\nAn average person relies on two food delivery apps to order a meal at least three times per month.\nForecasts predict that by 2024 the number of users who rely on platform-to-consumer delivery and restaurant-to-consumer delivery will be the same at 965.8 million.\nAnd while this is dividing the landscape, it’s also providing ample opportunity for businesses that are willing to accept this change.\nThose that can offer their food through both channels (dedicated food platforms and private websites or apps) are the ones that look to gain the most.\nSo for restaurants and dark kitchens that want to tap into this consumer base, on-demand food delivery is the only way to reach this goal.\nBut this doesn’t come with its own set of unique problems.\nOn-demand food delivery is a challenge. Offering direct-to-consumer delivery is a difficult undertaking at best, both inside and outside the kitchen.\nFor restaurants that are yet to enter the game, it means embracing the concept and creating a system from scratch that can support it.\nFor dark kitchens and on-demand food platforms, it’s an uphill battle to win over customers and make them accept the new way of doing things.\nBut for everyone in the food delivery industry, it means upholding a high quality of food and service standard without sacrificing price or profit.\nAnd this is where many problems appear because consumers are always looking for faster, cheaper, and better to get their food.\n#1 Providing faster food delivery. When it comes to speed, time is of the essence.\nAccording to statistics, 58% of consumers are not willing to wait more than 40 minutes for their delivery.\nThis means not just increasing the efficiency of the staff that prepares the food but improving food order management, fulfilment, and creating a suitable delivery network that can support it.\nThe biggest complaint food delivery customers (17%) make is that their food isn’t warm or fresh enough on arrival.\nWhile we won’t go into the kitchen, faster food delivery and optimized drop-off can certainly help in the matter.\nSurprisingly, it also means you have to be near your customers.\nWhile 79% of consumers still choose delivery over takeout if your restaurant is 3km away, the further you are the far less likely they are to order food from you.\nThat’s because customers relate distance to a slower delivery.\nAnd when only one in four people are prepared to wait an hour or more, you will need to overcome this challenge by removing those concerns.\nOne way is to create a supply chain that can match capacity with demand. The other is to provide a better service.\n#2 Improving the quality of your service. Six out of seven complaints that irritate your customers involve some level of mismanaging service quality.\nThat’s over 70% of the complaints customers have with your service.\nBusinesses that can keep these concerns at a minimum can win over customers even at the cost of a slower delivery.\nGetting everyone involved in the delivery of your food on the same page is the first step to achieve this.\nThe staff that receives orders has to have clear lines of communication with the delivery team.\nOn the other hand, they also need access to the kitchen to relate customer demands.\nBut to really improve service you need to let customers voice the concerns they have with your delivery.\nAllowing customers the ability to rate the quality of the service is a keystone solution to finding out all of its pitfalls, especially when 1 in 4 delivery drivers admit to eating customers’ food.\nAnother way to improve customer experience and relieve some of their tension is to give customers greater control over their delivery.\nFor example, providing customers with a tracking link when they order food lets them stay on top of the whereabouts of their delivery and ETAs.\nAdditionally, it’s worth establishing a direct line of communication between the customer and the deliverer.\nNot only does this improve customer satisfaction, but it also reduces missed food deliveries.\n#3 Ensuring the correct price of your delivery. Food delivery is a numbers game.\nAnd while it comes at a substantial cost, there is one thing going in your favour.\nCustomers don’t mind spending money on delivery.\nThe only thing you have to determine is how much are they willing to pay for your delivery still to turn in a profit.\nBut keeping customers (and staff) satisfied with the price of your service isn’t easy.\nAccording to statistics, customers are willing to pay on average $8.5 for their delivery, including the delivery fee, service fee, and tip.\nBut if you want to create a truly cost-efficient food delivery, you need to go beyond price.\nYou need to optimize your operations to minimize cost and maximize output performance.\nThat’s where delivery management software comes in.\nHow does delivery management software solve this? Delivery management software is the ultimate end-to-end solution for delivery.\nWhile it is a special tool that can help you attain measurable results, it’s also industry-specific.\nIt works differently when you want to manage field service, from when you want to know how to compete with Amazon, to when you want to improve your food delivery.\nAnd we think that’s super important.\nYou could even make a case that it functions like food delivery or restaurant delivery management software.\nA unique system in its own right that meets the specific needs of food delivery.\nBut why is it so great?\nThat has a lot to do with how it solves the above-mentioned challenges of on-demand food delivery.\nAn end-to-end solution tailored to restaurants and dark kitchens. Food delivery software for restaurants and dark kitchens takes a holistic approach to planning, tracking, organizing and executing delivery across the supply chain.\nIn other words, from the moment the meal is ordered, down to when the deliverer hands it to the customer, and beyond.\nA system like eLogii takes a platform approach to the problem.\nThis allows you to integrate with any tool vital for your eatery.\nFor example, a temperature monitoring app that maintains the freshness of your food, or an order management system you use to receive and send out orders.\nOn the other hand, delivery management software is also modulated.\nIt contains all of the tools you need to increase the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of your food delivery.\nFrom route optimization software components to delivery scheduling and tracking, down to a delivery app for drivers - it’s all built into the software for food delivery.\nBut that doesn’t mean you need to take it all. You can choose different plans tailored to your needs or hand-select components for your delivery.\nIt’s a cost-effective solution. You would think that all of those capabilities would cost you a lot of money.\nBut you would be wrong.\nUnlike legacy solutions that require a hefty upfront investment, this kind of multi-restaurant delivery software is pay-as-you-go at a low annual monthly fee.\nAll thanks to the cloud-first approach to delivery logistics.\nThis is useful when you want to increase efficiency without investing too much money.\nEnhanced usability means faster adoption.\nUnlike other solutions that appear on the delivery management software market, it’s extremely straightforward and easy to use.\nFood delivery logistics software comes with a dashboard for your dispatchers and order managers. And a delivery app for drivers and delivery agents.\nWhile the dashboard simplifies operations by relying on familiar actions, like drag and drop, the delivery app resembles other smartphone apps people use outside of the workplace.\nThat can cut the learning curve significantly and reduce the time it takes your team to adopt it, without sacrificing functionality.\nAnd the faster you integrate any new piece of technology into your existing operations, the less money you are losing.\nA feature-rich environment increases transparency and flexibility. Agility is a hallmark of the fast-paced food delivery industry.\n Want to know how to build an agile delivery operation? Follow the link.\n One way meal delivery management software achieves it is through greater visibility over the delivery process.\nFor example, the dashboard lets your stationary team track each delivery in real-time.\nYou can use that information to auto-assign orders based on the nearest or best agent so that when a deliverer arrives the delivery is ready for pick-up.\nFood orders not being ready has been a major complaint by 52% of the delivery personnel.\nOptimizing pick-up lets you reduce their pain, which means you retain a happier workforce.\nOn the other hand, it also lets you maximize their performance output and boost key metrics in delivery logistics.\nGaining insight into driver location, vehicle capacity, and ETAs to and from drop-off, lets you better plan and schedule deliveries as they arrive.\nIt also means you can combine that knowledge with the route optimization capabilities to batch deliveries together and increase the speed of delivery while reducing waste at the same time.\nFrom a business perspective, this saves you a lot of resources while raking in maximum profit.\nAnd when it’s time to scale your delivery operation, you can do it with much greater flexibility since there is virtually no limit to how many deliveries, orders, or drivers the system can support.\nMeeting customer expectations head-on. As much as attracting new customers is important, retaining recurring customers is far more critical for restaurants and dark kitchens.\nIf you can offer a food delivery that makes them feel cared for, they will repay the kindness by recommending your business to other customers.\nThat’s why you need to provide them with a great experience from the moment they place their order.\nAnd here is where delivery management software can help you achieve that goal.\nFirst off, taking advantage of each optimizing opportunity shortens the waiting time.\nThis helps you achieve the 30 minutes or less goal for each food delivery.\nBeyond that, automating the entire food delivery process means you can integrate it with multiple channels while managing each order from one central hub.\nFrom dedicated food platforms and apps to phone calls, this makes it convenient for customers to order their meals from you regardless of how they want to do it.\nAnother key feature of delivery management software is that it lets you open a direct line of communication to and from your customers.\nFor example, after you assign an order to a delivery agent, the software can automatically send tracking codes to customers or use alerts to notify customers about the ETA.\nOn the other hand, the delivery app lets drivers directly communicate with customers so they can provide more precise information about their time of arrival.\nA driver can simply message customers and let them know he is en route or provide them with a more accurate drop-off time.\nDrivers can also use the app to check information about the task, such as the customer’s personal data, delivery location, or type of order, reducing the chance of mix-ups, late or missed deliveries.\nAt drop-off, both the driver and customer don’t have to waste any time manually filling out receipts.\nInstead, they can use the built-in electronic proof of delivery to confirm a successful delivery.\nOn the off chance that the delivery doesn’t arrive, or the customer is unsatisfied with the delivery service, they can voice their concerns via the internal rating system.\nIt’s a far less painful way of letting customers vent their dissatisfaction than say, social media.\nAt the same time, it provides you with a source of feedback both about your service and delivery team.\nThis kind of multi-level customer service is the only way to win over customers in the age of where they hold all the power.\nBut for on-demand food delivery to work, restaurants and dark kitchens also have to keep a close eye on cost, speed, and output, not to mention optimizing for greater performance.\nHaving a system like delivery management software is proving to be a key tool when you want to achieve those goals.\nDo you want to achieve that for your business?\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

Like you would in a physical store.\nAnd that’s what customers want.\nBut why does it matter SO MUCH to them?\nIn this post, we’ll let you in on the answer and explain how you can meet those expectations with a small delivery operation.\nPlus, we’ll show you how to manage same-day delivery using delivery management software.\nNot to mention, why you need this delivery logistics solution even when you want to provide a slower next-day or two-day service.\nHere’s what you need to know.\nCustomers want convenience. Speedy delivery is all about convenience. And convenience is the bread and butter of every consumer because it improves customer experience.\nAccording to McKinsey:\n Same-day delivery combines the convenience of online shopping with the immediate product access of stationary retail.\n That makes it the cornerstone of modern retail.\nIn fact, a PwC survey found that the biggest factors among customers doing business with any brand are actually convenience and customer experience. Far more than price.\nAnd that’s why customers attach value to fast delivery. Because it gives them immediate access to their purchase.\nIt’s also psychological. Having their deliveries in the palm of their hand the same day when they order their purchase feels like going into a store and buying it.\nBut that doesn’t mean fast fulfillment is limited to online shopping. Physical stores also need to offer rapid delivery.\nIt might be convenient for local customers to walk into the store and buy goods or services, but for others, it isn’t.\nCompanies that fail to realize this risk of losing customers. Not to mention, they won’t attract new ones.\nTechnically, potential customers won’t even consider them.\nBut to create a fast delivery system, you will also have incorporate other solutions into the mix to settle other customer pains and make their experience even more convenient:\n Letting customers choose delivery windows and arrival times; Delivery tracking and tracing; Creating a system of alerts and notifications about ETA of delivery; Allowing drivers and delivery agents to communicate with customers; Incorporating electronic proof of delivery to streamline drop-off; Focusing more on customer service during drop-off; Upselling products upon delivery.  All of this can be achieved by incorporating delivery management software.\n(But more on that later)\nFor now, it’s enough to remember that speed equals convenience. And here is one way to achieve it.\nDevelop an omnichannel approach to speed up delivery. Back in 2005, when Amazon rolled out its two-day delivery for Prime users it was revolutionary.\nThink of it like when people first stepped onto a steam train after riding on horseback. The speed was captivating.\nBut, it’s now the standard for any delivery.\nThe same is happening right now.\nWhen Amazon announced that it will offer same-day delivery to all its Prime members in 2020, many businesses were overwhelmed by the news. Now, many are scrambling to do the same.\nAnd one of the best solutions to come out of it was the omnichannel approach to delivery.\nAs the COVID-19 outbreak has shown, delivery is no longer an option. Companies that offer it are surviving despite it, while brick-and-mortar businesses are struggling to stay afloat.\nAn omnichannel delivery can help you with this. Not only does it allow you to introduce delivery and online sales into your existing model, but it also helps you speed it up.\nBasically, after you create an ecommerce store, you can leverage your physical store to use it as a warehouse.\nIn the front, operations would continue as usual. But in the back, you will have created a pick-up spot that can cater to all deliveries ordered across all channels of communication (ecommerce, phone, storefront, email, social media).\nAnd despite what you might think about the cost of same-day or next-day delivery, the opportunities ahead couldn’t be bigger.\nSame-day delivery is an opportunity. The reality is that you have to offer faster delivery to customers.\nAnd even though two-day or one-day delivery seems like safe bets, the real money lies with even faster fulfillment.\nThat’s because same-day delivery lets you win over customers, both old and new.\nEven though it comes at a cost, there are ways you can make it work.\nThe reason behind it: customers don’t mind paying for faster delivery (if the price is right). They are even willing to pay for next-day delivery.\nAccording the same PwC survey, 88% of consumers are willing to pay if it means they will receive their goods faster.\nThis leaves you room to reduce delivery time without raising expenditure or risking profit. Not to mention, you can even learn how to compete with Amazon by co-existing.\nMore importantly, faster fulfillment is a great way to improve your position. In other words, generate more profit.\nBy offering next-day or same-day delivery, you provide greater convenience. That makes you more attractive in the eyes of your customers, and more competitive both among online and bricks-and-mortar retailers.\nBut to achieve that, you still need to drive the cost of fulfillment down and optimize your delivery to maximize performance.\nLuckily, technology solves that problem for you.\nHow can delivery management software help you achieve same-day or next-day delivery? Here’s where technology comes into play.\nWithout innovations helping with delivery tracking, planning, scheduling, route optimization, or dispatch rapid delivery remains a pipe dream.\nIf you take a look at Amazon or Walmart, they rely on technology for two reasons.\nAnd while Amazon has the luxury of employing robots in its warehouses or investing in driverless vehicles, it isn’t the end of the line for small and medium businesses.\nFor companies that fall under this category, delivery management software is the end-to-end solution to speed up fulfillment.\nFirst, it helps speed things up across the supply chain. Second, it reduces human error.\nFor example, route optimization software components can save valuable time during drop-off. In turn, drivers can complete more deliveries during their daily runs.\nNot only that but with communication flowing through one channel (the delivery app), there is less room for error or misunderstanding.\nUnlike legacy solutions, modern delivery management tools also operate on the cloud. This means they are available and affordable even for the smallest business.\nNext, modern systems solutions like eLogii let you optimize the entire delivery process, from orders through fulfillment to delivery and return.\nMany of them also take a platform approach to delivery management software which reduces costs and cuts time to implementation, since it allows you to integrate with existing systems or key apps essential to your infrastructure.\nAnd when it comes to learning how to use delivery management software, it is straightforward thanks to its user-friendly interface that functions like most apps your staff is used to.\nFinally, delivery management software is easily scalable.\nIf you’re small today, it doesn’t mean you won’t grow tomorrow. So, having this kind of system lets you expand your delivery operations without thinking about the future size of your supply chain, fleet, or delivery volume.\nWith low upkeep at a lower price, fast implementation, and an even faster learning curve, not to mention the ability to adapt and scale, delivery management software is the technology that can get your delivery to next-day and same-day fulfillment.\nSo, why not try it right now?\nStart a FREE TRIAL eLogii is an end-to-end delivery management platform that operates on the cloud.

(And How Can Delivery Management Software Get You There)"},{"categories":["Delivery Management"],"contents":"Delivery is changing at the speed of light.\nEleven years ago, customers wouldn’t have dreamed of receiving a delivery half-way around the world in just a couple of days.\nBut that’s the reality of modern delivery.\nDisruptive technology, innovations in planning and delivery management, customer service, and even Amazon, all play a major role in shaping the future of delivery today.\nTechnically, the (r)evolution of delivery is already happening.\nWhat will happen? What technology is driving the change today? How can you improve delivery and keep up in this age of disruption?\nIt’s time to take a look at the future trends that will shape delivery in the decade to come.\nHere are our top 11 picks:\n#1 Delivery solutions continue moving to the cloud. Thanks to cloud computing, delivery management software is no longer a pipe dream for many organizations.\nThe market landscape is full of Software as a Service (SaaS) companies like eLogii, that offer cloud-based solutions at every business level.\nIn many cases, this has opened up the door for small and medium organizations to adopting the cloud-first approach to delivery logistics.\nAt the same time, cloud-based systems don\u0026rsquo;t restrict the use of on-premise legacy solutions. In fact, they allow companies to use cloud technology to integrate into a broader ecosystem that can support and complement their on-premise software.\nAs a result, more and more companies are leveraging the functionality and UX of cloud-based software to increase flexibility, downsize cost, and maximize the scalability of their delivery.\nAnd according to McKinsey, this has caused spending on cloud adoption to grow six times more than other IT spending in 2020.\n#2 An omnichannel buying experience is no longer a choice. As e-commerce skyrockets to even greater heights, businesses will have to make even greater leaps to offer an omnichannel buying experience to shoppers.\nWhat the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus has shown is that having a bricks-and-mortar store is not enough.\nBusinesses need to pull their resources together and create a seamless shopping experience across all channels, online and offline.\nBut this puts a lot of stress on the delivery logistics as well as the supply chain.\nTo achieve this, organizations will have to move away from the single or multi-channel supply in favour of omnichannel supply. But also, rethink the delivery and adopt new ways of planning the supply chain.\n#3 Faster, and faster, and even faster order fulfilment. For companies, faster fulfilment has always been a tug of war between convenience and cost.\nFor customers, it was always wishful thinking.\nAll of that changed once Amazon stepped on the scene.\nOffering fast fulfilment has been one of the cornerstones behind its success. Amazon was able to leverage other revenue to offer consumers what they always wanted: on-demand delivery.\nDespite most customers’ willingness to wait for their delivery 3-4 days that window is quickly shrinking thanks to Amazon fulfilment.\nCurrently, the standard is a jaw-dropping two-day delivery (when compared to a just decade ago).\nAnd as Amazon continues to offer its next-day and same-day delivery to all its shoppers, other companies will have to learn how to compete with Amazon delivery and increase the speed of fulfilment.\n#4 Creating an agile supply chain will be the key to success. To achieve faster fulfilment, companies will need to rely on the agility and flexibility of their supply chains.\nThis is a significant departure from traditional delivery planning that favoured reliability and low cost.\nInstead, speed and convenience are priorities of today’s consumers.\nCompanies need to keep up with this demand and adapt to the new landscape since customers no longer care if they have to pay to receive that kind of service. All they want is for you to get it done.\nTo do that, you have to turn to delivery management software to create more flexible systems of operations. This will allow you to achieve two things:\n Respond to changes on short notice Scale operations faster when demand exceeds your capacity  Having an end-to-end solution, like delivery management software, enables companies to overcome these challenges via increased visibility over operations and real-time actionability.\nFor example, thanks to delivery management platforms, your dispatchers can already alter driver schedules and add deliveries as they come in.\nThis increases the rate of the fulfilment of the entire delivery and more importantly drives higher customer satisfaction.\nBut that’s not the only way customers will influence trends in delivery management.\n#5 Customers drive home the point for sustainable logistics and eco-friendly delivery. If companies want to win over modern consumers, they will also need to share their beliefs and values, and demonstrate real social responsibility.\nOtherwise, companies seriously risk the boycott of their products or services.\nIn fact, 57% of consumers say they are ready to boycott their favourite brands which don’t share their social beliefs.\nYou could have seen this first-hand in effect when people negated brands that didn’t support the Black Lives Matter campaign.\nIn the future, the biggest social issues will be sustainability and eco-friendliness.\nUPS marketing director for the UK, Ireland, and Nordics, Kiel Harkness supports this by stating:\n \u0026ldquo;Sustainability is a topic that everyone needs to get behind; congestion and corresponding pollution is a growing problem that urban cities across Europe and the UK are working hard to reduce.\u0026quot;\n Don’t get us wrong, people will still pay the top price for convenience or effectiveness. But they also won’t mind spending a little bit extra, if it means choosing a green delivery.\nAnd you can see this trend already unfolding.\nAs the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business reports, the demand for products marked as sustainable grew 5.6 times faster than other goods.\nThat’s why many companies are already taking steps to reduce their carbon footprint, as they invest in Green Logistics, circular supply chains, and recycled or reusable packaging.\nThis doesn’t mean that companies don’t benefit from it.\nFor example, deploying route optimization software to plan deliveries is greatly reducing fuel consumption and cost. While reverse logistics is helping companies make money by sending back used products for refurbishment or the recycling of raw materials.\nAnd these steps are also driving other trends into contention.\n#6 Robotics and automation set to speed up inventory management and fulfilment. In response to the need for sustainable omnichannel supply chains that are both flexible and agile, companies are turning to robotics to increase the speed of labour-demanding tasks.\nAs with everything, Amazon has been the front-runner, leading the charge for automation.\nThe company has already equipped warehouses with robots to speed up inventory gathering.\nIt is also investing heavily in unmanned vehicles and drones to serve its last-mile delivery.\nHere’s how Amazon’s fulfilment will look in the coming years:\nEven though it might not seem like it, investing in robots to perform repetitive tasks reduces the cost of human labour and increases output.\nIn the future, this will free up the necessary resources to provide fast and cost-effective delivery.\nAnd while there is still a long way to go to total automation of shipping, in many countries around the world plans are underway to increase the robots-per-human density in the next ten years.\n#7 IoT is increasing transparency across the supply chain. The Internet of Things (IoT) is already commonplace among delivery operations. And in the future, it’s difficult to think that it will become anything less than a keystone feature.\nIn fact, the number of organizations using IoT has grown to 25% as of 2019. And in 2022, forecasts predict that number will achieve annual growth of 13.6% each year.\nAs that happens, more companies will have the opportunity to connect facilities, devices, and equipment into a unified network to increase transparency over the supply chain.\nThis will allow companies to react faster not only to consistently changing scenarios in the field but also to prevent events that might hinder operational success.\nFor example, sensors attached to fleet vehicles and connected to operation hubs will report wear and tear on fleet vehicles. This will allow teams to schedule regular maintenance or request spare parts before a vital resource is put out of order.\n#8 Big data plays a greater role in delivery planning and logistics. Thanks to the adoption of cloud computing and IoT, big data is already playing a part in delivery planning and management.\nIn the future, this role will expand to even greater heights.\nCurrently, companies focus on collecting vital data about customers, operations, and developing conditions in the field.\nAs this information becomes available, it will help shape delivery both in terms of understanding past performance and providing key insights into future trends.\nFor example, monitoring key metrics in delivery logistics will help optimize every segment of end-to-end delivery.\nAt the same time, it can provide key data on where and how much resources to invest to achieve the results.\nAdditionally, large databases of customer information will provide invaluable knowledge into consumer behaviour and delivery preferences.\nThis will help planners achieve greater accuracy when determining the future strategy of the delivery and help them reach their target goals based on those decisions.\n#9 Leveraging prescriptive analytics to improve decision-making. Before now, diagnostic and predictive analytics have been successfully implemented in many supply chains to great effect.\nWhere one helps you track past performance, the other gives you insightful forecasts for the future.\nHowever, when it comes to decision making they share a common fault: They don’t give you key data to make informed decisions.\nInstead of answering questions What happened? (diagnostic analytics), and Why did it happen (predictive analytics), prescriptive analytics answers two more important questions:\nWhat will happen?\nWhat should I do?\nIt will let you know what steps to take to ensure future results that allow you to reach your goals.\nAnd that’s something most delivery managers want to know in the first place.\nIt’s also why prescriptive analytics will have a big impact on the future.\nAnd already, Gartner predicts that the market share of prescriptive analytics will reach $12.35 billion by 2026 at an annual growth rate of 26% from 2019.\nSo, it’s something you need to watch out for in the future.\n#10 Integrating AI and machine learning with delivery. With big data and prescriptive analytics, the need to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning as part of the digitalization of delivery is becoming increasingly apparent.\nBut, companies are not just using AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze and use big data.\nAccording to Gartner, 37% of companies have adopted some form of AI in their day-to-day operations. And when talking about both AI and machine learning, Gartner experts note that:\n“AI/machine learning, can potentially and significantly disrupt existing supply chain operating models.”\nSo far, companies have leveraged the power of AI and machine learning to integrate it with other systems, such as cloud-based delivery management platform or warehouse automation.\nAs a result, they have been able to automate repetitive tasks such as inventory management; provide key insights such as identifying shopping patterns among customers; and support existing systems such as delivery and route planning.\nBut as the digitalization of delivery grows, the use of AI and machine learning will only increase and spread onto other key operations.\n#11 Upselling in the field will become a part of the delivery experience. Recently, companies have started upselling products during delivery.\nIs it a myth? Or is it a reality?\nA delivery driver would drop-off your order, and politely ask if you want to buy anything else based on your previous deliveries.\nThink of them as travelling salesmen who know what you want and never leave you empty-handed.\nThis type of delivery experience has only been enabled by two recent trends:\n Data processing, which has provided detailed insight into customers’ shopping patterns, and; Digitalization of the supply chain, which has taken over repetitive or laborious tasks and freed up the workload of your staff.  Based on the purchase histories of the customers on their route, drivers can stock their vehicles with additional inventory and sell them directly (should the customer ask for them again).\nBut this isn’t just a clever way to increase revenue and minimize delivery costs.\nMaybe, a customer forgot to order something from your website, and the thought of paying for another delivery put him off the purchase. By offering the item at his doorstep, you demonstrate higher customer service.\nAt least for now, customers see it as a deeper level of care and convenience.\nOne thing is certain though, upselling will become a major part of the delivery experience in the years to come.\n Read our full guide to **upselling and cross-selling with delivery **to find out more.\n The delivery revolution is coming. Will you be prepared? When looking at the trends that mark the delivery landscape in 2020, two patterns emerge.\nOne is the digitalization of delivery and the supply chain. The second is adapting to the changes brought about by these disruptive forces.\nAnd when it comes to your delivery, it’s necessary to take both steps to secure a bright future for the next eleven years of your company.\nA good place to start is with delivery management software.

And you shouldn’t!\nWhat you should do instead is to adapt your delivery and learn how to exist together with Amazon.\nAnd there are more than a few ways you can achieve that.\nDON’T compete with Amazon. When it comes to shipping and fulfillment, you can’t compete with Amazon.\nNo one can!\nStrictly speaking, not even Amazon fulfillment can rival Amazon.\nAnd that’s the point.\nAmazon’s are regularly a substantial chunk of their revenue. In 2019, the company spent 40.23 billion on shipping.\nBut Amazon doesn’t need to cut its losses. It can sacrifice profit because it has other revenue streams that make up for that.\nSo, the goal can’t be to compete with Amazon. All you need is to stay in the race.\nBut Amazon was never the real problem.\nThe crux of the matter lies with your customers. Amazon was just the spark that ignited the fire.\nWhat Amazon did was change the game by shedding light on what consumers want and giving it to them.\nIt’s a run-of-the-mill supply vs. demand situation. Amazon just took advantage of it.\nAnd what do they provide?\nAmazon offers customers speed, low prices, availability, free delivery, convenience, fast and easy payment (among many other things) with EVERY DELIVERY.\nThey created ON-DEMAND DELIVERY. That’s what you’re up against.\nBut that’s something you can compete with.\nAnd to do that, you need to learn how to improve delivery operations and focus on meeting customer expectations by providing a service your customers want.\nHere’s what you can do:\nLeverage your bricks and mortar presence. It’s no secret that in-store shopping is in decline.\nAs we speak, retail store sales are plummeting, while sales from online shopping continue to climb.\n(And we all know who is the winner there)\nBut that doesn’t mean that your bricks and mortar store is at an idle loss when you compare it to your webshop.\nQuite the opposite. A physical store remains a vital link in your supply chain.\nYou can leverage these two features to improve fulfillment in your local area.\nWhile Amazon has to build huge warehouses to store its vast inventory and workforce to service your community, all you have to do is repurpose your store (or at least part of it).\nInstead of having two separate storage/pick-up sites, or investing in a new depot location, you can use the store as a warehouse.\nBesides cutting down costs, it also increases the efficiency of your delivery.\nIf you operate your service locally, a brick and mortar store can increase the speed and efficiency of your last-mile delivery.\nOn the other hand, if your delivery has to cover a larger area, opening a different depot site lets you divide the range of operations into zones and reduce the stress on your capacities.\nAnd while Amazon might offer cheaper deals, they won’t be able to match the service standard, nor the rate of fulfillment. (At least among the locality)\nNurture a customer-centric service. If you ask your customer what does he or she want from a delivery, most will answer a great customer experience.\nBut what makes a great customer experience great?\nIn 2020, PwC carried out a survey about the future of CX to find out. They asked consumers:\n What represents a great shopping experience? How important will it be in the future? Are they willing to pay for it?  Above the fold is convenience.\nA typical customer wants to receive his delivery as FAST as possible and to choose the DATE and TIME when it arrives. (Preferably, with a +/- 30-minute gap)\nUnless you are Amazon, this is not practical from a business point of view. So, it has to be a balance of convenience and efficiency.\nA good thing to remember is that customers are willing to pay for that level of service.\nIf you can give them the option to choose a date and time of day when you can deliver them the order, they won’t mind the cost of shipping.\nThis can significantly streamline the checkout flow and possibly reduce your shopping cart abandonment rate.\nKeeping them in the loop about their delivery is another convenience customers look for in a great service.\nAn easy way to do this is with delivery management software.\nIntegrating this digital tool into your delivery operation lets you automate scheduling, dispatch, and routing, and makes it easier to plan delivery around drop-offs.\nThis works both when you want to allow customers to hand-pick the date and time of arrival, and when you want to notify them about the location of their delivery.\nFor the best experience, a customer service operative can send a tracking link to the customer.\nProvide value with every delivery. Now, take a closer look at the previous graph again. What do you see?\nListed right there at the top are a friendly and knowledgeable service, personalization, and human interaction.\nThis is where Amazon fails in comparison and where your brand has the upper hand.\nBecause of tight schedules, fear of penalties, and rumoured poor treatment of its workforce, Amazon’s staff doesn’t have the time or motivation to nurture a customer relationship that has those qualities.\nNot even Prime members receive more than a simple “Hello. Delivery for John. Sign here. Thank you. Bye.”, which is a far cry from what customers expect at their doorstep.\nHowever, you and your drivers don’t operate under the same burden. And that means you can take better care of your customers.\nIf you include a time window for drop-off and equip drivers with a delivery app that lets them communicate with customers directly, they can leave a good impression and nurture relationships with your customers.\nImagine a driver in a clean uniform who sends a message saying “I’m on my way” or “I’ll arrive in X minutes”, knows my name, and has the time to exchange a few words.\nAs a customer myself, I know I would be more than happy to do business again with that company.\nA personal touch like that is all it takes to provide value for customers and create a memorable experience, regardless of what Amazon has on offer.\nPlus, you can count on positive reviews and ratings.\nOnce word gets around your customers will attract new customers, without you even lifting a finger.\nAfter all, there is no better marketing than word-of-mouth.\nImprove your shipping offer. One of the biggest reasons Amazon is so successful is the way it offers delivery options to its customers.\nLet’s face it, who wouldn’t want to get free two-day shipping?\nFor retailers, this is bad news.\nAs a company that provides the delivery services, that’s simply too expensive (even for giants like Walmart).\nBy raising customer expectations when it comes to fulfillment, Amazon has forced those same expectations onto everyone else in the retail industry.\nBut the goal still isn’t to compete against Amazon (or Walmart for that matter), it’s to offer as much convenience and customer service as your resources and capabilities permit.\nConsumers love free shipping. In fact, it’s the number one reason why 79.8% of shoppers in the US pick Amazon.\nAnd while you probably don’t have the resources to match Amazon fulfillment, there are ways you can make your shipping deals more enticing.\nOne of the best ways (even at the smallest scale) is to offer free or discount shipping above a certain price threshold.\nA survey found out that 48% of consumers are more likely to add items to their shopping cart to qualify for free shipping. While a case study by Red Door discovered that adding a free shipping threshold can increase orders by 90%.\nSo, despite a high investment requirement, it is still highly likely that you will see a substantial return on it.\nFor example, Typo offers free shipping for orders over £25. But it also includes exceptions and limits their offer only to the United Kingdom. This ensures they maintain profitability even when shipping products for free.\nAnother way to provide free shipping is to create loyalty-based incentives for returning customers, similarly to Amazon Prime membership.\nNot only is it a great way to retain your customers and fend off Amazon, but creating a fanbase around your brand is a far more lucrative option than attracting new customers.\nAdditionally, you can include free delivery as an add-on or gift as part of your delivery offer.\nFor example, if you have an expensive product or a product that doesn’t sell often you can incentivize customers to buy it by offering to deliver it for free.\nYou can do this also for products that are cost-effective and easy to deliver, and even for your best selling items (as they have the best chance to bring in more new customers).\nIf none of this is achievable (or affordable), then stick to a flat service rate for all your deliveries.\nEven though you are not offering free delivery, sticking to the same shipping price regardless of the volume, motivates customers to purchase more products.\nAfter all, two items for the same price of delivery is better than one.\nFocus on rapid fulfillment. Shoppers don’t have the patience anymore to wait for weeks to receive their orders.\nAlmost half or 44% of consumers want their purchase to arrive within two days from when they place a delivery order.\nHowever, Amazon’s move towards free same-day delivery for Prime members means they have reset the game.\nThe bad news is consumers are now even more anxious to get their orders faster than before.\nBut the good news is they don’t mind paying for it.\nIn fact, 88% of consumers are willing to pay more on their orders if it means receiving same-day delivery or faster shipping.\nAnd if you can supply your customers with faster delivery options, this is a great opportunity to give Amazon a run for their money.\nLuckily, there is one area of delivery where you are already better than Amazon, the local last mile.\nThe HUGE size of Amazon’s global operations means their logistics network is stretched too thinly to cover deliveries at all locations at the same speed (at least for now).\nIf you focus on providing fast and consistent same-day delivery to your nearest customers, you can survive and even thrive in spite of Amazon’s dominance.\nBut to do it, you will need to focus your energy on rapid end-to-end fulfillment and work to reduce delivery cycles.\nThe best way to achieve this is to rethink your delivery strategy to remove non-essential steps in the process and optimize your operations via automation.\nOptimize your delivery operations to maximize output and performance. Optimizing delivery fulfillment isn’t a quick nor easy way to fight off Amazon.\nBut in the long run, it repays itself manyfold.\nAnd when it comes to optimization, technology is the key.\nAccording to Gartner, apart from customer service, the biggest priorities for retailers in 2018 and 2019 involved some level of supply chain optimization using technology.\nThe best way to automate delivery is through delivery management software.\nThe best delivery management software platforms offer end-to-end features and capabilities, from route optimization and depot management to customer service and even reverse logistics.\nSystems like eLogii support API integration, a cornerstone of API-based commerce which has been labeled among the top ten emerging trends in digital commerce.\nThese features allow you to reduce costs and increase visibility by streamlining the delivery process and removing the unnecessary waste of resources.\nFor example, optimizing routes for delivery drivers compresses delivery cycles, which enables them to complete more deliveries and promotes rapid fulfillment.\nIncreasing profit and productivity and reducing cost through optimization releases resources to develop other solutions that we’ve mentioned, like improving your shipping offer or customer service.\nUltimately, this is what enables you to drive home an Amazon-style experience with all the perks and benefits of your brand.\nEven more importantly, it is what will allow you to retain customers and attract new ones in the age of Amazon delivery.\nReady to make the first step? eLogii is an end-to-end delivery management platform that operates on the cloud. By keeping one eye on the pitfalls of the software our delivery operations relied on, and the other on future innovation, we have created a powerful solution that can overcome all the challenges of delivery in retail.\nThat’s why we offer you to START A FREE TRIAL right now by clicking on the link, no questions asked except one:\nWhat’s stopping you from taking that first step in the next step of the evolution of your delivery?\n","permalink":"https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-compete-with-amazon-delivery/","tags":["Ecommerce","Delivery Logistics","Last-Mile Delivery","Delivery Management Platform"],"title":"How to Compete with Amazon Delivery?"},{"categories":["Delivery Management"],"contents":"We recently analyzed the delivery management software market.\n(You can see what we found out here)\nBut our research also got us thinking about another important question when it comes to managing last-mile delivery:\nIs a platform approach a better way to go than an application approach?\nWe did the research and here’s what we found out.\nConsumers drive delivery. As your customers look to receive far more for far less when it comes to delivery, you will need to continue to look for ways to match and better those expectations.\nRight now, your customers want greater speed.\nThe contemporary consumer is no longer satisfied with long waiting periods.\nThe same-week or 2-day delivery doesn’t cut it anymore.\nInstead, they want you to take faster action.\nAccording to statistics, more than half of the shoppers (55%) in the U.S. prefer same-day delivery to any other arrival time.\nOn the other hand, one out of four customers list rushed, one-hour deliveries as the main choice when they want to receive orders.\nTo achieve these speeds and meet your customers’ expectations, it’s vital to turn to technology as an enabler that can drive performance without too much sacrifice.\nDelivery management platforms are the solution. Delivery management software is the answer that can achieve for you those speeds at a more reasonable cost and a greater convenience to you and your customers.\nA mesh of disconnected apps can achieve this, but it doesn’t have the necessary power to make a big impact on key metrics in delivery logistics.\nSo, to do it right, you need to take a new, modern approach to manage delivery using technology.\nAnd that’s where a platform approach comes into play allowing you to integrate the relevant elements of your technology stack (for example you order management software or accounting software) to produce a turnkey solution.\nWhat’s the difference between an application and a platform approach to Delivery Management Software? The difference between the application and platform approach boils down to how you use it.\nA delivery management software app works like a user interface.\nIt’s a self-contained solution that includes all of the functionality within the system.\nAn application can integrate with additional software like a CRM or accounting system to allow data exchange between the system via APIs, but is limited to complementary systems only.\nA delivery management software platform is a more robust solution. It can easily integrate with any other software system to complete a specific process and extend its capabilities beyond the core functionality into a broader ecosystem.\nBut the ecosystem can also plug into the platform.\nThat makes a platform approach to delivery management a highly adaptable solution that can integrate with any internal delivery fleet.\nImprove dispatching and routing of deliveries. Dispatch and routing are a challenging part of any delivery operation regardless of your industry.\nYou need to match the best delivery to the best delivery agent for the job, calculate an optimal route for each one, and more.\nUsing a delivery management platform can get you there because it can integrate into a broader ecosystem.\nA platform allows you to include relevant data from the entire supply chain (inventory and driver status, order locations, drop-off ETAs, etc.) when dispatching and routing deliveries.\nThis is extremely important for any business that operates an internal fleet.\nYou can use the vast pool of data not only to assign deliveries based on the best driver or route, but also to make decisions based on price, performance, availability, and many other factors.\nAnd that lets you keep costs down, performance efficiency, drive output, or concentrate on any delivery logistics KPIs that help you achieve your goals.\nGain visibility across the entire operation. One of the biggest benefits of gaining visibility over your delivery operations is the possibility to generate actionable data and insights on key stages of the process.\nBut how can you achieve this?\nOne way is to leverage delivery management software.\nDelivery management software lets you monitor and collect information from end to end, from the different elements of the delivery.\nBe it inventory and fleet locations, or customer order reporting, it can help you work out exactly where you need to make adjustments to drive operational efficiencies.\nBut even with the help of technology, it is difficult to use it to that effect in real-time and in a broader ecosystem.\nThat’s where a platform approach comes into play.\nBecause a platform can integrate with various systems, you can leverage innovative and disruptive technology like machine learning to process data and translate it into actionable insights.\nThat lets you use technology not only to collect and manage incoming data as it arrives but also to shape it into adjustments that optimize your delivery operations down to the smallest detail.\nTake a look at what the eLogii platform can help you manage:\nRemain focused on key activities Delivery is a multi-channel operation.\nEven the smallest delivery service relies on different teams of professionals (internal vs external delivery fleet) to handle different stages of the process.\nAnd each one of your team members relies on specific reports and dashboards to perform their tasks.\nFor example, a depot manager has to have visibility over pick-ups and drop-offs at his site but doesn’t need to know the position of every vehicle in the fleet like an operations manager.\nA delivery management platform can outfit each team with a dashboard that provides unique controls specific to all those roles.\nLimiting capabilities to task essentials via different permission levels also reduces workload.\nIt allows teams to remain focused on performing key responsibilities as efficiently as possible.\nThe same is true when it comes to reporting.\nCreating custom dashboards to receive key information streamlines the flow of data up and down the chain of command.\nThe right data input achieves two things for your staff:\n It gives them mission-critical information they need to complete each task, and; It gives them an overview of the next assignment once they have completed a task.  Reducing surplus information helps drivers or dispatchers focus on details that improve output and performance.\nOn the other hand, it lets you divert attention from information about day-to-day activities in favour of KPIs and other key insights that boost the efficiency of the entire delivery operation.\nDrive excellent customer experience. All of the benefits of a platform approach to delivery management funnel down to customer experience.\n(Exactly where we started)\nBut that doesn’t mean the customer journey starts with dispatch or route optimization.\nCustomer experience starts at checkout.\nThere, customers face decisions that will affect the cost and ETA of their delivery.\nIf they choose a less expensive delivery, will you ship their package at a later date?\nCan your system handle rushed deliveries?\nOr schedule same-day delivery?\nAnd if you offer those service features, how will that affect the cost of fulfilment, on-time delivery rate, or your other KPIs?\nAll of these questions affect the customer experience.\nBut they will also determine the tasks you will need to perform to complete delivery orders.\nThat’s why it’s so important to choose the right delivery management software, and take the platform approach to your delivery.\nLuckily, we can help.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

And what to look for when you come across this type of system.\nMost importantly, we’ll share with you the key to enabling delivery with your fleet more efficiently without breaking the bank or losing out on some essential features.\nPlus, we’ll let you in on a secret about what we think is the best solution.\nMore on that later.\nFor now, if you want to cut costs, increase output, drive more efficiency, and make it easier to manage day-to-day delivery operations (without losing visibility or control), keep reading.\nLet’s get started.\nWho Needs Delivery Management Software? As much as online shopping and home delivery are driving factors in the on-demand economy, so too Delivery Management Software has become necessary in the delivery arena.\nBut who benefits from delivery management solutions? And what types of businesses can use them?\nIt benefits both customers and the company that uses it. Customers receive an outstanding service they desperately need, while companies can provide such services and still maintain a healthy profit margin.\nWhen it comes to businesses, it can improve the delivery operations of any organization regardless of its size, stature, or type of industry.\nA small business that operates one or two vehicles locally will mainly benefit from the ability of the system to improve cost-effectiveness.\nDelivery Management Software can optimize routes such that the business can handle more deliveries despite the limited resources, while not taking on too much risk or sacrificing the quality of the service.\nAs for medium businesses, Delivery Management Software gives them the tools they need to grow and scale their operations.\nThey gain the ability to expand their service offer regionally or cross-country while maintaining the same level of control and visibility across all delivery activities.\nBesides all of these benefits, enterprises see investing in Delivery Management Software as a way to increase the efficiency of their large-scale operations beyond its current state, while still making room for innovation.\nIf an organization is running at maximum capacity at a minimal cost, it can introduce new offerings or integrate the latest technologies much easier into their current system.\nAnd all of this can be applied across various industries and markets.\nThe feature-rich nature of some delivery management solutions enables a significant level of customisation based on the use case in question.\nThis allows the software to meet the demands of most commercial enterprises.\nIt can easily integrate with any specific service or technical requirements, or incorporate regulations that govern the market.\nThat’s why a variety of companies use Delivery Management Software as their go-to choice:\n Food and beverage Retail delivery Pharmaceutical and healthcare Construction material and DIY Restaurants and dark kitchens Field service Third-party and courier services  Systems like these can just as easily accommodate the technical specs, such as vehicle requirements for example refrigerated trucks or vans in the food and beverage industry, as they can the unique nature of the service itself, which is the case in the field service industry.\nLikewise, companies can input industry-specific rules into the system.\nFor example, you can make sure delivery people meet the required safety measures when delivering construction equipment or implement the good distribution practices of sensitive deliveries as the case in the pharmaceutical industry.\nBut it’s also important to make a decision based on the unique requirements of your company. And to do that, it’s worth taking a look at what’s on offer.\nThe Market of Delivery Management Software A decade ago, Delivery Management Software would have been a good tool to own. Today when demand is exceeding capacity, the increasing complexity and cost of the last mile make it a decisive necessity when managing delivery operations.\nThis has also opened up the market for Delivery Management Software providers. The choices available to you now are astonishing. But also overwhelming.\nPerhaps, that is why it is so important to take a look at what kinds of solutions, features, pricing plans, and trials are on offer to you at the moment.\nOn-premise vs. SaaS Delivery Management Software When it comes to the deployment of Delivery Management Software there are two main options to choose from: on-premise and cloud-based solutions.\nOn-premise providers sell the perpetual license to their software at a one time cost, and it is installed and set up on the user\u0026rsquo;s private systems, infrastructure, and servers. And because of that, it is also the more expensive option.\nUpgrades and additional modules? - you guessed it, same again!\nBesides the cost of purchasing the license or copy of the software, the user of on-premise software has to invest in software security, server and computing hardware, system integration, and in-house tech support. Only then can an organization benefit from the software to its full extent.\nHistorically, it was one of the most common delivery management solutions and traditionally reserved for large-scale enterprises that could afford it.\nThese days, companies that can support on-premise solutions like Paragon Routing choose them due to the perception of better security, greater features, long-term cost-effectiveness, and complete control over the software.\nHowever, the high upfront cost and low flexibility mean it’s not attractive to many small and medium-sized businesses, and in most cases out of their reach. Also, practically speaking many of the ‘perceptions of old’ are no longer true. That’s why many of today’s companies are choosing SaaS over on-premise.\nSaaS solutions offer software that operates on the public cloud (or in some cases on a private cloud) and sell it as a pay-as-you-go subscription (paid annually or monthly).\nAfter acquiring the service, the user receives access (a login) to the software on-demand with the ability to enter and store data, while the provider remains responsible for managing and updating the system via the cloud.\nCloud-based software is an Operating Cost vs. a Capital Cost which is the case with On-Premise Software usually.\nTogether with its always-up-to-date features, better connectivity, and user interface, it is easier to integrate. And because it operates on the Cloud, it is also more agile, flexible, and scalable.\nThe continual evolution of cloud computing is managing to fix key concerns like security while eclipsing all others with the benefits and power of cloud-first adoption.\nAll of this has paved the way for SaaS companies such as eLogii, Onfleet, Bringg, Tookan, Getswift, Routific, Maxoptra, and others to offer their cloud-based systems as the superior derivatives of Delivery Management Software.\nWhat is the difference between Dedicated Delivery Management Software and Distribution Logistics Software? If delivery management solutions are to be successful, their focus and range of features need to be use-effective when applied to delivery operations. To serve them, rather than complicate them.\nAnd in these terms, two variations appear. One involves dedicated software solutions, while the other is distribution logistics software.\nSo, what is distribution logistics software?\nDistribution logistics software is an expansive solution that can address every stage of supply chain management. These systems incorporate a broad range of software pieces that deal with delivery, distribution, transportation, telematics, freight forwarding and brokering, as well as shipping and fulfillment.\nWith companies like Descartes, delivery is only a part of the overall functionality of the logistics system. The focus of their software gravitates more towards global distribution and trade than the last mile.\nThat’s why this type of software is used by large-scale enterprises that can use its capabilities to operate their supply chains at an international level.\nBecause of this, the software is also more complex and not so well-suited to meet the unique challenges of last-mile delivery. And that’s where dedicated systems can help organizations.\nThen, what is a dedicated Delivery Management Software solution?\nDedicated Delivery Management Software is a software solution tailor-made to meet the unique needs of delivery using the latest tech stacks and software architecture. The system consists of one central platform modulated to support each stage of the supply chain.\nEach module has a different purpose. Where one deals with driver schedules, another with route optimization, a third one might control dispatching or customer service.\nAnd while every component tackles a specific demand, all of them work interconnectedly within the dedicated software solution.\nCompanies that have developed these systems such as Onfleet, Bringg, or eLogii have made it possible to manage delivery operations more efficiently, regardless of the size of the business that uses it.\nDedicated solutions also pay more attention to the appearance of their software solutions.\nWhile distribution logistics software is difficult to adopt and master, the sleek and intuitive user interface of dedicated platforms makes it easier for delivery teams to learn how to use them.\nThe specialized focus and delivery-driven functionality combined with a streamlined dashboard is yet another reason why dedicated solutions are becoming more and more popular among companies of all sizes.\nHow much does Delivery Management Software cost? On-premise and SaaS solutions are also different in the way companies pay for their services. And the cost of these solutions depends on the type of software you decide to purchase.\nTypically, an on-premise solution is a tremendous Capital investment, which comes at a high upfront cost.\nApart from purchasing the perpetual license or a sanctioned copy to the software, the company also has to supply all of the private infrastructures that will support the system.\nThis includes buying in-house servers and other computing hardware, hiring tech staff, as well as investing in other software architecture like security and firewall systems.\nHistorically, the tremendous upfront costs have meant that the only companies that could attain on-premise solutions were businesses that could afford it. Usually, only large-scale enterprises.\nAnd while technologies like Paragon, Descartes, or Trimble TMW offer custom enterprise pricing the HUGE upfront cost means their solutions remain the more expensive option. A solution that remains out of reach for most small and medium-sized businesses.\nEnter SaaS solutions.\nSaaS (software as a service) companies take an entirely different approach to both how they sell their software as well as how they price it.\nUnlike on-premise, SaaS providers only sell access to their software. In return for a subscription fee, a company can use the software via the public cloud without any additional expenses.\nThere is no need to invest in additional infrastructure, or costs to system integration, support, and maintenance.\nNot to mention, a SaaS solution is an operating expense (Opex), rather than a capital expense (Capex).\nBecause of this, most small-to-medium businesses today can afford this type of software for their delivery service.\nSo, how much does a SaaS Delivery Management Software cost?\nThe average price of SaaS solutions starts in the $100s per month, but the price can also be higher or lower depending on the payment model or the length of the contract.\nLuckily, payment models are as flexible and diverse as the software solutions themselves.\nCompanies like eLogii, Onfleet, and Tookan offer different payment packages depending on the capabilities you need and the size and complexity of your operations.\nHowever, all three companies include custom pricing plans especially at the enterprise level, while the cost of the contract is reduced depending on the type of subscription (monthly vs. annual).\nBest of all, the price tags remain the same regardless of the number of vehicles in the delivery fleet. This kind of flexibility means it’s much easier to scale operations and why it’s becoming such a popular solution among businesses.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, there are companies like Maxoptra, Routific, and Optimoroute that price their solutions per vehicle per month.\nThe vehicle-based payment model is great for businesses that require basic features to manage their small delivery fleets. But it can become less cost-effective when it’s time to scale your operations.\nMost vehicle-based payment models are also tier-based. Advanced features remain locked until you update to a higher package deal.\nCombine this with a growing fleet of vehicles, and it can become a lot less affordable, even with a fleet of five delivery vehicles.\nAnother unconventional payment model comes from GetSwift. An Australian company that offers their SaaS solution for a task-based fee (cost is established per delivery per month).\nAgain, this can be a good option for small-scale delivery services that are either just starting off or the nature of the business doesn’t support too much traffic.\nSo, if your plan is to rapidly scale your delivery service, the best choice is usually the simplest, pay-as-you-go monthly (or annual) subscription that most companies offer.\nWhat’s the Best Delivery Management Software? No surprise here. In our opinion, it’s eLogii.\neLogii is a new entrant to the market. When it comes to the capabilities of our software solution and the service that we offer, it has the power to handle most, if not all the demands of modern delivery, regardless of the size of the operations in question.\nAfter years of on-the-ground experience building the leading asset-light last-mile delivery business in London, a business now doing millions of dollars of profitable sales, we knew there was something missing in the market.\nWe understand the challenges of day-to-day delivery operations intimately, and what can go wrong and how to leverage technology to enable a successful operation.\nUsing our operational learnings we have iteratively built technology to enable some of the most complicated delivery use cases in the market, and clearly understand the problems from an operational perspective. And that’s how and why eLogii was brought to life.\neLogii is an end-to-end cloud-based delivery management system that can support any delivery operation from the first to the last mile.\nAnd while many solutions claim to do this, we have actually accomplished it. TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF, and see.\nOrganize operations from one platform. Unlike having many different applications to handle each step of the delivery process, all you need is one.\neLogii is a dedicated solution. One central platform lets you automate all your delivery operations, from planning and routing to scheduling and execution.\nOur modular platform has six core functions:\n Routing and planning Operations management Fleet management Customer experience Insight and analytics  But within each of those modules, there are also several other aspects of the delivery you can customize and configure to your need, like reverse logistics or electronic proof of delivery. And all of these options can be managed on one dashboard.\nStay on track with your team. Losing sight of drivers on the field during their daily routes is a real nightmare. And it’s an easy thing to happen, especially when there are so many tasks to handle during rushes or peak cycles.\nThat’s why visibility is crucial to quality assurance of any service. But how do you gain visibility across the entire length and breadth of the operation?\nWith eLogii.\nOur Delivery Management Software gives you that essential bird’s eye view of the entire delivery process, from start to finish. Be it the same day, next day, next week, or something sooner like the next hour, you can have a clear view of what’s happening live on-the-ground and what’s going to happen at every moment of each and every delivery lifecycle.\nThanks to the intuitive mobile app (iOS and Android compatible) for drivers that is available alongside our operator dashboard, driver tracking, and statuses are available in real-time. This gives you actionable insight at all times and allows you to manage all your resources efficiently and effectively.\nThe combination of driver tracking and live delivery statuses across the entire last mile allows you to proactively monitor performance against delivery schedules, customer requests, as well as keeping communication in context and up to date.\nLet’s say a new order has just arrived. What do you do?\nGo to the dashboard. Click re-optimize and the system will automatically assign to the most relevant driver, taking into account all your operational parameters. The order will then fit seamlessly into the Driver’s queue taking into consideration the live, real-life factors that may impact the successful delivery of an order (i.e. traffic, ETAs, time-windows, etc).\nYou can handle more deliveries faster than before while removing a lot of the burden from your team and ensuring your customer requests are always met.\nDispatchers can generate tasks quicker (manually, imported via CSV or API) and communicate them much more efficiently. Drivers will always remain in the loop and spend less time and fuel completing the task.\nMost importantly, increasing visibility will allow you to optimize routes and schedules more efficiently and effectively than ever before, handle more pickups and/or deliveries,, cut costs, keep customers happy, and maintain a profitable operation that you have complete control over.\nIntegrate eLogii with any other system you use. If you’re already using a number of other software applications to receive your orders, communicate with your customers, or even manage your delivery fleet, you may want all this information to communicate seamlessly and automatically with your Delivery Management solution.\neLogii can easily integrate with virtually all internal or external systems or applications, thanks to our flexible APIs. This will allow you to connect and manage all the relevant information for your delivery operations easily, in one place!\nFor example, if you are using Shopify to sell your products, all you need to do is connect your Shopify account or any other e-commerce or order management system to eLogii using our APIs.\nAnd once your integration has been completed, you’ll be able to receive orders directly to the main eLogii dashboard where you can automatically optimize and route your orders taking into consideration any relevant operational constraints. In addition, you’ll be able to sync all your delivery information and statuses, with your existing internal systems.\nGet the best value for your money. We’ll be honest with you, eLogii may not be the cheapest option in the market, but that’s because eLogii is more of an all-encompassing solution than otherwise available in the market, allowing you to save significant cost in the long-run.\nWe guarantee there is no other solution on the market that offers such a wide range of features and capabilities at such an affordable price. In many cases, features that don’t exist in the market today or would otherwise only be available to large-scale enterprises from other vendors, at a very large cost.\nWe also offer flexible payment plans that meet your needs, as well as plans that suit the scale and stage of your business.\nTAKE A LOOK AT OUR PRICES, and see for yourself.\nCreated with your business in mind. Despite what you might have heard, Delivery Management Software is geared towards any (and every) business with delivery operations.\nAt least, that’s how we see the landscape, and how we developed our software. So, everyone can use it!\nUnlike a lot of other solutions, eLogii can handle any delivery operation regardless of the size of the fleet, the number of pickups and/or deliveries you run each day or the complexity and constraints of your delivery operation itself.\neLogii isn’t built with a specific industry in mind, either. It can comfortably handle food or retail deliveries, as it can healthcare and construction, or even field service operations and third-party logistics.\nThe best part: it’s highly customizable. So, whatever the needs of your business, the system can take it no questions asked.\nManaging deliveries just got easier. One of the challenges with introducing new and disruptive technologies is that being ahead of the curve doesn’t always mean everyone has caught up with the technology.\nWe wanted to avoid the complicated interfaces of the past, and bring Delivery Management Software to the 21st century.\nThat’s why our dedicated solution has all the functionality of a powerful end-to-end system, minus the cumbersome design, logic, and process flows associated with traditional, legacy solutions.\neLogii is built with an intuitive user interface following the latest best practices in UI and UX design, enabling the user to always be in control of the operations, easily.\nIt’s much easier to teach and train staff to use the new system, which means it\u0026rsquo;s much more scalable to use and implement organization-wide.\nBut we also wanted the transition to be as painless as possible. We understand that not all organisations want to have a full-blown API integration from day one, and so all data can also be seamlessly added and exported from the system using CSV files.\nYou can either use our CSV templates to import your data, or create your own custom mappings to your existing CSV files. Our workflows are designed to be as simple, seamless, and easy-to-use for everyone.\nGive customers a delivery service they deserve. The truth about delivery (unless you’re a courier company!) is that it has long been seen as a cost centre for your business.\nOn the other hand, customers are demanding more efficient and timely delivery, in today’s world. And keeping your customers satisfied is one of your primary business objectives.\nSo, in order to meet the needs and demands of your customers in today’s digital age, not just offering delivery itself is important anymore, but also the overall delivery offering and experience that you provide.\nToday’s modern customer wants their orders delivered fast and on time with the quality of care that would make a newborn blush.\nAnd eLogii lets you take control of your operations to deliver the best service possible for your customers each and every time.\nThe route optimization capabilities also mean that your delivery fleet will run as efficiently as possible, within your operational parameters.\nLive delivery tracking keeps customer service in the loop when each delivery will arrive. They can use the dashboard to see live ETAs for each delivery and notify customers accordingly, if not already being done automatically through the system using automated email and/or SMS notifications to customers.\nDrivers also have access to the relevant customer details via the delivery app on their phones. They can use that information to provide a much deeper level of service, which includes any bespoke delivery and/or collections instructions provided by the customer.\nDrivers also collect all the necessary proof-of-delivery items directly via the app (e.g. signature, photo, barcode, or any other custom confirmation), and this is available to see live in the operator dashboard at any time.\neLogii provides you with the perfect solution to ensure your customer is always at ease with your delivery offering, with ultimate peace of mind for safe and secure delivery.\nFinally, our solution also lets you gain insight into what customers think about your service. Each customer can rate the quality of the driver and overall service offering.\nThis gives you valuable insight into your operations and can help you to continually optimize and improve your service to your customers.\nTry it out for free right now.

Delivery management software (DMS) is a digital logistics tool used for planning, managing, optimizing, and executing delivery activities.\nIt is also a centralized system of communication that lets everyone involved in the life cycle of a delivery connect via one platform.\nBut what is the practical application?\nThis kind of software has a plethora of capabilities for each stage of the delivery lifecycle.\nIt integrates previously separate features like route optimization, customer support, reverse logistics, or ePOD, into one comprehensive system.\nWhile Delivery Management Software shares a lot of similarities with fleet management software, transportation management systems, or distribution logistics software, it is unique.\nIn contrast to those solutions, it takes a much more holistic and intuitive approach to delivery operations. And equally well-suited to outperform them in the first, as well as the last mile of delivery when taken as a whole, especially when talking about your private fleet.\nWhat is a Transportation Management System?

A transport management system (TMS) is a similarly specialized solution that deals with the planning, management, and execution of transportation/shipments.\nBut you shouldn’t mistake it for Delivery Management Software.\nUnlike Delivery Management Software, which is generally focused on your own fleet, a Transport Management System is more focused on external fleets, lane rates, customs processes etc.\nThat said, some like Trimble TMW look at private fleets, but these are now starting to get on a bit in years and some might call these legacy solutions in the context of modern operational needs.\nEven though it deals with much of the same logistical mechanics, the foundation it is built on lacks usability and functionality of modern solutions - think more command-driven vs. clean graphical user interfaces.\nSpeaking about TMS in general, they are usually less ‘dedicated’ solutions when it comes to private fleets. The focus here is on planning, routing, and optimizing cargo drop-offs before the last mile.\nFor example, its target audience is mainly the large road freight industry and generally speaking with a high proportion of outsourced transportation.\nLike Delivery Management Software, these solutions often are able to be connected to other systems (warehouse management systems for example) but the issue is that many of the legacy solutions do not have usable APIs when it comes to integrating with more modern systems.\nWhat is Fleet Management Software? And what are Fleet Telematics Systems? Fleet management software and fleet telematics systems are another set of digital tools used for managing delivery operations.\nIn the most basic sense, these systems enable the exchange of data between agents in the field (the delivery fleet), and the operations’ hub (HQ).\nOften (wrongly) labelled as Delivery Management Software, these solutions are less advanced and intuitive.\nBoth also function much differently. Instead of proactively supporting delivery operations, they look retroactively (for example what happened on the road vs. what is happening on the road).\nThis is very useful to the main use case of this type of software: insurance and fleet safety purposes.\nThere, these systems shine. They can provide valuable insight into driver behavior that might lead to a crash like harsh braking or excessive acceleration of the vehicle.\nBut when you want an all-encompassing Software system to manage your deliveries, this shouldn’t be your go-to choice, at least not standalone.\nBenefits of Delivery Management Software Let’s be honest, not all modern ideas stick. But if there wasn’t any innovation in the world, people would probably still be schlepping goods and services on foot.\nAnd Delivery Management Software is an innovation that is REVOLUTIONIZING delivery.\nDon’t get us wrong. Many companies still use modern fleet management software, telematics, and transportation management systems.\nBut they don’t come close to the functionality of delivery management solutions when dealing with the challenges of specifically delivery.\nSimply put and unsurprisingly, Delivery Management Software and delivery are a great fit together.\nYou can clearly see this from the capabilities on offer:\n Procurement and shipment of deliveries; First and last-mile capabilities; Internal and external fleet management; Handles various types of vehicles, vehicle capacities, and drivers; Real-time fleet management; Advanced visibility and flexibility; Streamlined internal and external communication.  Many examples of Delivery Management Software are built for the future of delivery using new and disruptive tech stacks, such as cloud computing.\nThis completely changes the way operators interact with these systems and how they can control deliveries.\nIt has also made these capabilities available to almost any company regardless of the size, shape, and budget pertaining to delivery operations.\nWith Delivery Management Software, even the smallest operator can easily handle distribution across its fleets, from the first to the last mile of delivery.\nA solution like this is highly flexible and customizable. It can easily adapt to meet the demands of its environment. It allows you to keep your current equipment and infrastructure while improving the way you manage it.\nFor example, you can easily include different types of vehicles, vehicle capacities, or fleets into the program. The system doesn’t care.\nIt also means you can switch between using a private or external fleet, depending on how you do business.\nAnd since it’s completely dedicated to delivery, it has a greater depth of detail when it comes to how you optimize routes, plan and manage depot sites, or handle deliveries on a day-to-day basis.\nBecause it runs on the public cloud (or on request on a private cloud), the team involved in every delivery has access to the same data across the entire company with the ability for this to be tailored to their specific operational need.\nThis also means the entire process of planning and scheduling is live. While intuitive platforms and apps provide a greater field of real-time viability across the whole operation.\nTeams can also communicate with ease, as they share information from the field and the office via one system.\nAnd when you have all of these capabilities in one place, you can scale operations much faster and easier than ever before.\nWhat is Field Service Management Software? And how is it similar to Delivery Management Software? To answer this question, we need to start at the beginning.\nLet’s take a look at what field service management software is, and the field service itself.\nField service involves any work carried on the customer\u0026rsquo;s behalf at their location as part of the service offer. The work is performed on-site by field agents who install, update, maintain, or repair products, systems, or equipment provided to the customer.\nField service management is thus the organization of those resources. And then there is the tool that makes it easier to do that.\nSo, what is field service management software?\nField service management software is a digital solution that helps service providers better manage operations on location.\nIt automates the process, and makes it easier to plan, schedule and execute service trips, as well as collect data from the ground and electronically invoice customers.\nIt lets you plan, track, and optimize those activities more efficiently, which maximizes output from teams in the field. And that’s very similar to the field service suite of Delivery Management Software.\nOf course, the crossover happens when you view and compare those similarities. For example, when you compare delivery drivers and field agents.\nWith modern Delivery Management Software, you can input different information on your drivers such as their vehicle (and its capabilities), skill level/types, or type of driver license.\nNow translate this into a field service suite and you can use those same to include specific engineering skills, job roles, or practical capabilities.\nPrecisely because of that crossover most field service providers can use delivery management solutions to automate their operations.\nEven when it comes to collecting data and invoicing modern delivery management solutions can integrate with external applications via APIs to enable this.\nSo, you can continue using the same software for those purposes, while gaining greater functionality of other features like route optimization, scheduling, or operations management.\nIn turn, you can significantly increase the output of your field service teams by increasing the amount of work they can do, while reducing fuel consumption and cutting costs.\nWhat is an end-to-end Delivery Management Solution? An end-to-end delivery management solution describes a platform, app, or software system that provides users with all of the software or hardware components to integrate the system and making it ready for use.\nIn that sense, an end-to-end delivery management suite can give you all of the mechanics necessary to meet the logistic demands of enabling delivery.\nThis software is a one-stop solution. It provides all of the tools to plan, manage, and optimize delivery activities on one comprehensive platform.\nAnd the benefits of integrating such a system into your delivery operations are more than plentiful.\nApart from not having to plan operations manually anymore, you can rely on one tool instead of a host of disconnected applications. And for everything and anything from managing activities and resources to meeting customer expectations.\nUsing one software solution is also more practical.\nYou can cut time from adoption to full use to mastery of the system. That can take a lot of the workload off you and your workforce, especially if neither party has previous experience with Delivery Management Software.\nThe quicker adoption and faster transition to digital logistics mean digitising your delivery operations and the fleet is less time-consuming and more productive and cost-effective.\nEnd-to-end delivery software itself can be either on-premise, cloud-based, or hybrid (a combination of the two).\nIn the past, the on-premise solution was the exclusive and widely used option. These days, however, cloud-based Delivery Management Software has taken centre stage.\nThe integration of cloud computing with the end-to-end Delivery Management Software suite will remain relevant in the future, as well.\nAs innovative and disruptive technologies emerge, cloud-based solutions will be instrumental in their adoption.\nFor example, some companies are already integrating AI data-processing algorithms to use third-party data with their delivery management systems. And machine learning will influence last-mile delivery even more dramatically in the future.\nThis wouldn’t be possible without cloud computing.\nAnd as the end-to-end suite continues to evolve (along with the tech stacks that support it), more companies will want to take advantage of its potential.\nWhy is Delivery Management Software becoming key for Last-Mile Delivery? So much has changed over the last decade in the world of delivery.\nThe spread of online shopping and e-commerce has been the spark that has ignited the fires of transformation in the delivery landscape.\nConsumers no longer view home delivery as a simple convenience but an important factor when deciding to buy your products or services.\nThose expectations have also caused demand to skyrocket. So much, that businesses across the board are scrambling to make it readily available to all of their consumers.\nBut having and operating delivery is an expensive investment. Not to mention, it\u0026rsquo;s a complicated venture. And businesses are always looking at ways to take the last mile to the next level. To make it easier to operate, more efficiently, and more cost-effective.\nFrom transportation management systems (TMS) and order management systems (OMS) to fleet management software and telematics, various tools have aided in this ever since the inception of digital logistics.\nBut while traditional systems like Paragon, Descartes, or Trimble TMW were a step away from manual management, they remain rigid, complicated, or expensive.\nBut this is where modern Delivery Management Software can improve the process.\nIt’s the solution that offers more. That provides the right features and capabilities to make last-mile delivery management more accessible.\nBe it for B2C or B2B companies, or industries as varied as food delivery and retail, or field service and third-party logistics operators.\nAnd while all delivery management solutions aim for the same goal, there are differences among them, especially since the adoption of the cloud-first approach to delivery management.\nCompanies like Tookan, Routific, or Onfleet focus on providing a modern SaaS solution to SME businesses across the board.\nOthers, like Bringg, have changed how businesses manage the last mile at the enterprise level.\nMore recently though, eLogii has created an end-to-end solution that is already revolutionizing how businesses use and view Delivery Management Software.\nAll the power needed for Enterprise applications, as well as accessible feature-rich plans for SMEs.\nIn today’s market, if you operate a delivery fleet, you have to have Delivery Management Software if you want your delivery service to compete and succeed.\nBut this has also opened up new opportunities.\nThe demand for delivery management solutions has never been greater than it is right now.\nAnd as the state of the delivery landscape during the COVID-19 pandemic shows, businesses that can keep up with the demand can prosper even in very difficult markets.\nHowever, having a delivery service just for the sake of it isn’t enough. Customers have evolved, as well. And their attitudes, beliefs, and expectations have changed beyond recognition.\nYour customers have more options than ever before. They are more well-informed about your brand, product, and offer, as well as those of your competitors. And they don’t trust either marketing message.\nWorst of all, it’s outrageously expensive to acquire each customer. But if you don’t make it convenient for them to buy from you, they will turn to someone else. And that’s even worse.\nSo, it’s the same story as before. You need to find a balance between catering to customer demand when acquiring them, while at the same time maintaining a firm grip overspending.\nAnd when it comes to delivery at least, you can achieve those goals with Delivery Management Software.\nWant to Try Delivery Management Software Right Now? eLogii is a delivery management platform that operates on the cloud.

And What Makes It Different?"},{"categories":["Delivery Management"],"contents":"A cloud has gathered over the last mile. It’s stirring up a storm over the delivery logistics landscape that promises to disrupt and turn the status quo in its favour.\nThe cloud in question is cloud-based delivery management software.\nIn the past, there was only one option. On-premise delivery management software (for example Paragon Routing) was a solution reserved for the deep pockets of the enterprise.\nNow, it\u0026rsquo;s anyone’s, and everyone’s game. The smart money is on the Cloud.\nLow upfront costs, fast deployment, high visibility, and even greater flexibility are some of the benefits of cloud-based logistics software. And experts across the distribution and delivery spectrum are embracing the Cloud.\nFor many of them, the cloud-first approach is a risk worth taking, especially since the only other option is often out of their reach from a cost and implementation perspective.\nBut it’s also a bold statement about things to come. As more and more companies move their operations on the cloud, the software will evolve with them.\nBut before you move forward, take a step back. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at what is cloud-based delivery management software and how it benefits companies that adopt it as their main tool for organizing, operating, and executing their delivery service.\nWhat Is the Cloud-First Approach to Delivery Management? When it comes to cloud-based delivery management software, the role of the Cloud is to make the software available to the users on-demand and provide the capacities to input and store data, but without direct management of the system itself which is reserved for service providers.\nAccording to Gartner, the leading experts and forecasters of technological innovation, the Cloud is also explained as:\n “\u0026hellip;a style of computing where scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are provided as a service to external customers using Internet technologies…”\n The cloud-first approach to delivery management refers to companies that use cloud-based infrastructure, platforms, or applications as their main tool to plan, manage, and operate their last-mile delivery logistics. These organizations rely on Software as a Service (SaaS) providers to use their platforms as a service, instead of the former model of taking ownership of perpetual licenses attached to on-premise deployments.\nHowever, that doesn’t mean that they don’t receive a quality platform. Companies that opt for a cloud solution usually end up with even better features and capabilities than those that rely on on-premise software.\nConnecting to a centralized delivery management system in the Cloud leads to a plethora of benefits, many of which raise visibility, performance, and efficiency of their last-mile operations. Not to mention, the solution is both easily scalable and is Operating Expense (Opex) vs. Capital Expense (Capex). Payment models are often flexible with pay monthly options available and generally even more cost-effective pay-upfront options are offered also. The longer the contract the lower the unit (monthly etc.) price is.\nA More Cost-Effective Solution Before the invention of cloud technology, last-mile delivery logistics solutions were on-premise. It was reserved almost exclusively for companies at the enterprise-level. Too expensive and unattainable for small or medium businesses.\nNow, cloud-based logistics systems are available to all. At an often lower cost, and certainly, with much greater levels of flexibility (Opex vs.Capex), companies can attain digital delivery management capabilities regardless of their size or the size of their operations.\nThis is all thanks to the way payment works for this type of technology.\nUnlike on-premise software that always requires full upfront payment, SaaS companies offer more flexible billing plans. These often include monthly-paid subscriptions or paid-upfront subscriptions (at a discount). Most importantly, there are no capital costs.\nThis doesn’t mean the cost of a cloud-based logistics software is always less than an on-premise one. The level of value gained, however, will likely be much higher with monthly subscription plans enabling easier entry and always-up-to-date features ensuring that the customer is always receiving great value for money. With on-on premise, such upgrades are often chargeable and there are generally professional service fees attributable as well.\nExpenditure is optimized, as well. Rather than paying for an entire software package and the unnecessary features you don’t want or need, providers of cloud-based software let you choose a plan that best suits your service.\nA company can pick features or capabilities it needs the most and choose a plan based on those requirements. It can also reject advanced features to lower the price or put off their purchase until it becomes an absolute necessity or the budget allows it.\nSome SaaS companies go as far as to allow their users to effectively customize their solution and attach the price of add-ons to the total bill.\nChoosing software based on the capabilities you need is a smarter investment than having to pay for everything. It\u0026rsquo;s why companies, even at the enterprise level that can afford and manage on-premise solutions find the alternative much more appealing.\nSo, it isn\u0026rsquo;t hard to see why more and more companies are turning to cloud-based solutions.\nIt’s an Equally Secure Option Even now, many experts cling to the notion that on-premise solutions are the more secure option when it comes to delivery logistics software. This comes from the belief that companies that own and operate in-house servers can store and access data safely under their exclusive firewall protection.\nOn the other hand, the hype around cloud computing has led others to believe in myths about its capabilities. One of them is that software operating on the cloud is more secure than similar on-premise digital logistics solutions.\nThe fact is that both sides are right and wrong at the same time. Software security is always a risk, be it on the cloud or on-premise.\nIn both cases, the biggest concerns are cyber attacks. But in the case of the public cloud at least, there have been very few recorded breaches in security caused by external factors.\nThe majority of security issues happen within the company and involve some type of user misconfiguration or mismanagement of the software.\nCustomer companies, alongside the delivery management cloud software provider, also have to assume responsibility for assessing the security capabilities of the software they choose, and train staff to operate it according to the directions of the provider.\nIf both parties share the burden of security, they will not only lower the risk of breaches but also maintain the quality of the delivery management system that brought both of them to the cloud in the first place.\nBetter Scalability Through Agility and Flexibility Apart from security, another concern with delivery software in the cloud was the loss of control. But as cloud computing gradually evolved, many of those key initial concerns were addressed or eclipsed by the sheer power and appeal of its benefits.\nThat was the case when companies found out how easy it was to scale operations with the new system on the cloud.\nUnlike on-premise solutions, cloud-based software doesn’t need to be installed. It’s accessible via the relevant user account on every device and from every location, while all of the upgrades, patches, and add-ons are handled by the vendor and automatically updated across the system.\nIf there is anything that requires installation, it is usually easy to do and related to the deployment phase or desktop and mobile delivery apps that improve the UI and UX for the workforce.\nAll of the features are continuously functional and available. If a company wants to add a new feature or increase the capabilities of existing ones, the provider can simply unlock them for that account after the two parties reach an agreement.\nUnlike the cloud, on-premise software is less flexible and too slow for agile scalability. If, for example, a company that operates its service in three cities, it would need to purchase, equip, and deploy the system at all three locations.\nBecause all locations operate independently from one another, it’s much harder to coordinate operations between them. Not to mention access data and issue tasks.\nThe agility of the cloud is attractive to the mobile nature of last-mile delivery. It’s the ability to apply multi-client and multi-channel options from one central hub is the ideal solution for the fast tempo of the contemporary delivery landscape.\nApart from flexibility, a centralized network like that also improves real-time visibility through advanced connectivity across the grid.\nHigher Connectivity Across the Entire Supply Chain Advanced connectivity is another central feature of cloud-based systems.\nUnlike traditional on-premise solutions that operate independently, software on the cloud is connected by the cloud via the Internet.\nThe entire network is connected through a single, centralized system. This allows organizations to plan resources when demand exceeds capacity, rather than being geographical constrained, and remain in communication with all the moving parts across the supply chain.\nSince all the data also flows in and out from one hub, it’s easier to share and access relevant information about past, future, and ongoing operations.\nThis raises end-to-end visibility over the service to a real-time level and permits operation managers to act and react to changing situations as they happen.\nBut the connectivity of a cloud-first approach also makes it easier to adopt and deploy the system. Because these systems operate on the Cloud, they can easily integrate with any other cloud-based solution, such as customer relationship management tools.\nNot only that, but this higher level of connectivity will be useful during the next stage of the digital transformation of the last-mile and lead to even more cloud-first adoption.\nWhat’s next for cloud-first adoption? There is no denying the fact that the future of the delivery logistics arena is firmly fixed in tech innovation. The change of the landscape brought upon the cloud has shown as much.\nBut the role of the cloud as a driving force of last-mile automation will remain relevant even as new technologies emerge.\nAlready, cloud computing is paving the way for the next wave of digital transformation. The connectivity and agility that is helping organizations achieve their business goals are also enabling integration with AI and machine learning systems.\nCompanies are using AI algorithms when extracting, analyzing, and using data from third-parties to increase the efficiency of the final mile.\nBut even more, changes are yet to happen. Companies that position themselves well now, will be in a better position to reach their goals tomorrow.

But it isn’t always so.\nThink of returning customers. Companies across the board adore the sound of the word return in that particular context. I know we do.\nAlthough it’s easy to see the appeal of that phrase, the same isn\u0026rsquo;t true for the word reverse in the context of logistics.\nFor years, reverse logistics has been regarded as a bad term, meaning failure for many who work in last-mile delivery especiallywhen demand exceeds capacity.\nBut it doesn’t have to be. And in fact, it isn’t.\nIn today’s competitive market with its intelligent consumers, that term has taken on a completely different meaning. One that represents untapped potential and idle opportunities.\nAll you have to do is treat it as such.\nThen, you can capitalize on the many benefits of reverse logistics that lie hidden beneath its meaning.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at what is reverse logistics and how it can benefit your customer experience and the bottom line.\nWhat Is Reverse Logistics? Reverse logistics is the process in delivery operations that controls the return movement of orders from their final destination. Its main purpose is the capture of value or proper disposal of failed deliveries.\nThat’s the definition of reverse logistics, but what does it mean?\nSimply put, it’s the logistical operation that covers a company’s return policy. If a product is faulty, damaged, or lost, or the customer rejects the delivery for any other reason or fails or is unable to collect it, reverse logistics are responsible for returning the item and ensuring the customer remains satisfied.\nIn recent years, it has become an integral part of delivery service operations. And although many businesses see it as a costly measure for ensuring customer satisfaction, its benefits increase the value of the company in more ways than one.\nReverse Logistics and Customer Service Why is reverse logistics so important for last-mile delivery? It all comes down to customer service.\nSome deliveries might be faulty, damaged en route, or mistakenly arrive at the wrong address. In these situations, it makes sense to allow returns and keep customers happy.\nIt’s also an excellent business practice. Allowing customers to return orders aligns your service with the modern consumer expectations.\nCustomers might not want to return deliveries, but they will want to have that option available to them. It lets you secure a positive experience and incentivize them to buy more from you.\nThink of it like this. If a retailer offers hassle-free returns on clothes, for example, a customer will make more orders to try out every item because they aren’t afraid of losing money. But once the order arrives customers are also less likely to return it, due to consumer psychology.\nFirst, they have had a chance to assess the product and estimate for themselves if the product really does bring value to their life. And in the case of clothes, if they fit and feel good, the customer is likely to buy all of them.\nMore importantly, they will have had the opportunity to touch the product, which leads them to establish a personal connection with the object. So, it becomes much more difficult to part from it.\nAdditionally, the process is a money-saving system for companies when it comes to purchased goods, as well.\nService teams can use it to collect reusable supplies, such as getting refillable containers upon return visits. This can be a more sustainable, and less expensive way of reducing production costs, as well.\nFor a customer, a good return policy is all about comfort and convenience. For a reverse logistics expert, it’s all about providing the best possible service efficiently and at the least cost.\nIf they can live up to those expectations then the process of returning items can have a massive impact on profit.\nHow Reverse Logistics Affects the Bottom Line When it comes to the reverse logistics process, it all boils down to numbers. How effective are the operations, as opposed to the cost of running them?\nBut one doesn’t have to look far to see its impact on the bottom line.\nAs mentioned before, a good return policy keeps customers happy and motivates them to buy more products. And there are many good examples of reverse logistics that do just that.\nAccording to recent statistics, the cost of running Amazon’s reverse logistics operations, including all other outbound shipping costs, amounted to almost $16.2 billion.\nHowever, the company was able to rake in global revenue from e-commerce in the range of almost $233 billion between 2015-2018 alone.\nWhen you take a step back down from huge enterprises, small businesses might think that it’s financially out of reach. But that’s until you consider customer loyalty and how it can drive income.\nOne thousand true fans will buy any product you sell. But to obtain their loyalty, you need to provide the best product, as well as the best service.\nIf you go out of your way to ensure a fast returns policy that can quickly replace any damaged deliveries, your customers will love you for it and become those true fans.\nBut recent advancements in technology have also made it possible to minimize the costs of running reverse logistics operations. So, that’s the direction companies should take if they want to offer refunds and returns to generate customer loyalty and maintain a positive bottom line even as a small business.\nHow Technology Makes Reverse Logistics More Efficient Delivery management software has improved the productivity of last-mile delivery logistics at all levels and across many industries. From route optimization to ePOD in environments like food and beverage distribution or field service operations.\nSince these tools benefit forward logistics so much, those positive effects would inevitably spill over into reverse logistics. And they have.\nControl of the delivery process has empowered both distribution businesses and their field operatives. Drivers can quickly access their mobile apps and report problems as they happen, while teams at the office can react as soon as they hear something from the field.\nVisibility, on the other hand, has enabled those teams to quickly assess available resources and scramble them to meet the new situation whatever reverse logistics model is at play.\nThis rapid flow of information also benefits the customer. Customer service representatives can quickly contact them and fix the problem, either by ensuring a new delivery (if the order is lost or damaged), or a refund of the cost of the order.\nIn both cases, the delivery management software lets them provide more accurate ETAs so customer satisfaction remains intact.\n We have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

But this is also creating new challenges for everyone involved in the supply chain.\nCompanies are finding it difficult to keep up with rising demand and evolving consumer expectations of the emerging landscape. For many, the existing operational capacity can\u0026rsquo;t bear the brunt of the surge in eCommerce, or it\u0026rsquo;s simply stretched too thin to handle it.\nIf companies with limited capacity are to tackle these challenges, they will have to change the way they operate their delivery services.\nA big part of that will involve answering the question: Are you still manually planning deliveries?\nFrom optimizing the way orders are received, prepared, and tracked, to how they are delivered. Not to mention how the process is automated and adjusted to scale.\nSo, even when demand seems to flood your capacity, there are more than a few steps you can take to keep your head above the water.\nOrder Batching The simplest way to handle deliveries is to complete them one at a time. But when the amount of orders is overflowing your capacity, it isn\u0026rsquo;t the best use of the available resources.\nOrder batching is a far better alternative, instead. It allows you to group multiple orders into one delivery run, which is particularly useful during peak delivery periods.\nTypically, organizations group two or more orders based on their shared drop-off location or estimated times of arrival (ETA). For example, restaurants and dark kitchens can batch lunch orders and set arrival times 5-10 minutes apart for three locations in the same city area.\nThis method of delivery is also more cost-effective. As there is no need for drivers to go back and forth to pick-up locations after each drop-off, the number of delivery runs is reduced. And that means more drivers are available to handle more orders at much better fuel per mileage cost.\nHaving fewer deliveries benefits both single vs multi-depot planning, as well. It speeds up the pick-up process by allowing resources at depot sites to be focused on just a few loading procedures at a time.\nKnowing what is order batching and how adopting it can help you increase the efficiency of your delivery service will make it possible to handle more orders and maximize the capacity of your service.\nOrder Prioritization When demand outstrips your ability to meet it, scheduling orders on a first-come-first-serve basis isn’t an option. Instead, you can selectively choose which customers to serve first, and relieve some of the stress brought on by high delivery volumes.\nRanking customers as top tier based on the value of their purchase or their loyalty as a consumer helps prioritize deliveries to them and ensures you meet their expectations.\nCapacity constraints and these methods of dealing with them are bound to affect the relationships you nurture with your customers. And while you might think that prioritizing would negatively impact the service experience of lower-tier customers, it doesn’t.\nA study on the topic found that prioritization didn’t affect organizations’ relationships with bottom-tier customers. It only increased the satisfaction of top-tier customers and improved their perception of the company.\nBut determining which orders are more important is difficult when large volumes of orders arrive at your headquarters.\nDelivery Management Software can enable you to automatically assign priority to each customer. The system will flag top-tier orders and schedule them for delivery first, which will minimize the workload of your fleet. Or rather, increase capacity so you can fulfil more orders.\nOutsourcing the Delivery Fleet Knowing how to deal with demand when it exceeds the capacity of your delivery service, also means understanding when is the best time to use your internal fleet vs external delivery fleet.\nOutsourcing delivery overflow to a third-party provider is an affordable way to quickly boost capacities and the competency of your service.\nBut unless you operate a mixed fleet, it is difficult to dynamically re-route deliveries on a day-to-day basis.\nInstead, organizations usually use last-mile carriers to increase their capacity when they know a spike in demand will happen, such as during special sales offers, peak seasons, or holidays.\nThat’s why it’s useful to predict movement in demand levels. And for that, you will need to do some forecasting.\nDemand Forecasting for Deliveries Forecasting demand is a powerful way of maintaining an optimal capacity of your delivery service based on information.\nEstimating probable demand based on past and current cycles gives you an oversight of movement during certain periods and helps you plan for them in advance.\nFor example, if a retail company observes spikes during the final quarter of the year, it can easily accredit them to Black Friday or Christmas sales, and actively take measures to ensure those orders are met in those periods.\nHowever, successful forecasting requires exact data. Advanced analytics tools are by all accounts the best way to track, record, and observe information associated with your delivery service.\nBut for those tools to monitor key metrics in delivery logistics, they will have to be connected to delivery management software.\nLast-Mile Delivery Software for Accurate ETAs Automation is the key to successfully increasing your capacity. From what is route optimization to digital proof of delivery, it can raise the performance and output of your entire service.\nBut when you want to deliver goods beyond your abilities, having a Delivery Management software system that accurately measures estimated times of arrival (ETAs) is paramount. And automating your delivery can get you there.\nWhat digital delivery systems can provide you is greater visibility over your available resources and capacities. This allows you to use the previous steps to schedule deliveries to the full extent of your service in real-time, and in the case of a capacity overload, to automatically spill orders to later drop-off runs.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, customers should also have the option to see more accurately when their deliveries will arrive. Not to mention select a different time slot in case their initial choice was unavailable.\nSo, automating the entire delivery process with delivery logistics software is equally important for customer experience, as it is for the efficiency of the operation itself.\nReady to Take the Next Step?

Electronic proof of delivery (ePOD) refers to a digital version of the delivery note (a document used to confirm completed deliveries and in some cases also to allow billing), and the software app that enables field agents to capture that data and verify the success or failure of their tasks.\nTraditionally, proof of delivery was a paper document (delivery order, delivery note, or docket) that customers had to sign to verify the receipt of the delivery and in some cases to allow the billing of their order.\nWith the advent of ePOD, however, the entire process was digitally transformed and improved.\nNow, companies can use digital proof of delivery to increase the mobility and flexibility of their operatives, while at the same time, gaining more visibility and control over the activities they perform.\nThe capabilities of ePOD also extend the volume of data companies can collect from their customers, reaching far beyond the basic name and signature.\nWith more information at their fingertips, companies can use it to their advantage to provide a better customer experience while at the same time reducing their operating costs.\nIt’s easy to see how the implementation of electronic proof of delivery systems benefits everyone involved in the life cycle of each delivery, and why many businesses, across all industries, are no longer delaying its adoption.\nHow Does Electronic Proof of Delivery Software Work? As it is used both by agents in the field and operators at the office, ePOD software commonly has two equally important components:\n A mobile application (or a module within a broader solution like eLogii) used to access and capture data on location; A digital dashboard (or a module within a broader solution like eLogii) used to add, revise, and monitor data from the office.  The workflow on, or as part of, a mobile app helps drivers and other agents in the field to collect proof of delivery at every drop-off location throughout their daily delivery run. At the same time, agents can also access information about their customers to provide a better service upon arrival at their destination.\nMost modern ePOD software (either standalone or as part of a broader solution) runs on iOS and Android operating systems, which makes it easier to choose devices that match operational requirements or integrate the software with existing catalogues of smartphones, tablets, or in-cab devices.\nApart from collecting electronic signatures, barcodes, QR codes, or other types of verification, electronic proof of delivery solutions might also capture time- and geo-stamps on each task as well as in some cases photos as well. After it is collected, all of the data from the field is relayed back to the central hub for registry and review. Some solutions such as eLogii enable this to happen on a live, as-it-happens basis.\nProviding access to the digital dashboard to office teams raises the transparency of the entire delivery operation. It lets essential staff monitor live operations, track information as it arrives, and make decisions in real-time based on that data.\nThe higher degree of visibility also raises the efficiency and accuracy at every stage of the delivery lifecycle with no extra cost to the company.\nTeams using powerful end-to-end software solutions of which ePOD is a part can use incoming POD data to modify routes, boost the performance of depot operations, or update driver schedules, and immediately send those changes to carriers in the field.\nAt the same time, it helps customers receive more accurate information about their deliveries, such as current status or ETAs, which enhances their experience with your service.\nThe Types of Data You Can Collect with ePOD A powerful digital proof of delivery systems is configured to capture data according to the operational needs of your organization.\nApart from the standard electronic signature, the most modern and advanced software supports other types of verification, including:\n Photographs; Custom forms; Barcodes; QR codes; Alpha-numeric fields.  As soon as your delivery agent opens the app on their device to verify the delivery at the drop-off location, the app automatically captures other relevant data, such as:\n Driver information; Vehicle information; Geo-stamps (geographical location); Time-stamps (time of delivery, also compared with timeslots, etc.)  After the data is collected, it is instantly transmitted to the central information hub for analysis by the team at the office.\nWhat Are the Benefits of Electronic Proof of Delivery Software? Given that digital proof of delivery is flexible and scalable, it benefits small, medium, and large companies across a range of different industries, from food and beverage distribution to field service operations.\nRegardless of the size of your company, type of industry, whether you are operating an internal or external fleet, integrating ePOD can transform your operation into a more efficient and cost-effective delivery service.\nHere are nine benefits that let you see how:\n1. Eliminating the Need for Paperwork Removing paperwork from the delivery confirmation process is by far the biggest benefit of mobile proof of delivery software to any organization.\nManually collecting data is a time-consuming process. It is marked by long delays between the stage of gathering information and processing it. And it relies on a medium that is easily damaged, lost, or destroyed.\nBy contrast, digital proof of delivery software is easy to use. The mobile ePOD software lets carriers collect data from the field with the swipe of the screen, which minimizes the administrative and financial burden filling out forms by hand.\nOnce collected, the app uploads the information into the system without delay, which becomes accessible to everyone in real-time and can’t be easily damaged or lost.\n2. Improving Communication with Customers Several features integrated with mobile ePOD software allow operators to ensure accurate information reaches the customer about their deliveries. These may include:\n Notifications and alerts, which help customers plan their time around ETAs. For example, following electronic proof of delivery integration service operators can send email reminders to customers on the day of the delivery, or a text message an hour before it arrives. Real-time delivery tracking, which helps operators and customers stay up to date with the status of the delivery and its location. For example, knowing the location of a package can help agents notify customers of its impending arrival. Information about the delivery, which helps operators confirm the receipt of delivery while enabling customers to add special instructions about future drop-offs. For example, ratings and feedback let operators know the performance of carriers at different routes, which makes it easier to assign them based on customer preferences.  3. Raising the Quality of Service Using an electronic proof of delivery app to verify the receipt of goods is a much more efficient method of confirmation. Not only that, but it’s also much faster, simpler, and more professional than using a paper docket.\nFor carriers, it also means having all the relevant information about the delivery and its recipient at the swipe of the screen, which makes it easier to provide a memorable service to customers at every drop-off.\n4. Increasing the Accuracy of Proof of Delivery Because digital proof of delivery provides a surplus of options when it comes to capturing data, a company can combine and custom-build its unique electronic form.\nFrom photos and driver comments to checkboxes and time-stamps, it gives customer service operators a greater depth of insight from the field, which they can use to provide more accurate information to customers.\n5. Enabling Real-Time Visibility Allowing information to flow from the field to the central hub lets operators at the office stay up to date with the latest developments. They can easily review data as it arrives, and quickly take action if the situation requires it.\nMore visibility also means more control and transparency. This results in better management of the fleet and a more dynamic distribution of resources, which can be useful to customer service agents when handling issues that affect customer expectations.\n6. Creating Consistent Workflow Connecting all teams through one platform creates a uniformed network across the entire delivery service, which develops a standardized process that the workforce can carry out consistently across various departments, depots, and stages of delivery.\nAt the same time, the system ensures everyone involved in the delivery complies with the standard when collecting data or creating reports, while the data itself is uniformed according to the same format. That consistency makes it easier to build a steady stream of data that everyone can easily access and use.\n7. Supporting Unique Service Requirements Even though the system provides consistency across the delivery service, it doesn’t forbid the disruption of the workflow to complete unique tasks or manage the process during specific situations.\nThis allows organizations to adapt the various stages of the service, or create completely customized workflows to meet client demands for their deliveries. All of which is facilitated without any resource-heavy changes to the system.\n8. Streamlining Internal Communication Using one platform to plan, manage, track, schedule, and complete tasks also make it easier to communicate internally.\nFor example, when drivers want to access some information on their delivery run, they can simply use the driver app instead of making unnecessary calls to operators at the office.\nAdditionally, the software is usually configured to send out automatic notifications to carriers, which also eliminates the need to contact other members of the team.\nIf, on the other hand, operators have to get in touch with carriers, they can simply use the integrated messaging system, which can be set up to deliver text messages either to individual agents or to groups of agents operating in the same fleet.\n9. Optimizing Performance and Output The ability to send and receive and access data instantly via the electronic proof of delivery devices boost the productivity of the workforce.\nIt makes it possible for drivers and carriers to complete more delivery drop-offs, as operators can dynamically schedule new tasks as orders arrive.\nRemoving the need for manual data entry also frees up vital resources for everyone involved in the delivery service, which can be put to better use completing more valuable tasks.\nMost of all, the vast amount of collected data can be used to optimize performance at every stage of the delivery process. Operations managers can analyze essential KPIs to uncover problems and fix them or simply take steps to improve various activities across the entire service.\nThinking About Adopting Electronic Proof of Delivery?

And although it might look like a good choice at first, there is a lot to consider when entering the On-Demand landscape.\nSo, tread carefully!\nThe rise of Delivery as a Service and Third-Party Logistics (3PL) companies has made it easier than ever before to outsource a delivery service. But with the benefits of low initial overhead, the choice to pay as you go, and fast implementation, come other challenges. Challenges you could better meet in-house.\nThe key is to treat it like any other investment.\nAnd like every other investment, you need to find a balance between these three factors:\n Operational costs and efficiency; Scalability and growth, and; Customer experience.  But to arrive at a decision, you first need to understand the difference between an internal and an external delivery fleet, and how each solution will impact your company. That\u0026rsquo;s why you\u0026rsquo;re here!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s everything you need to know about building a private delivery fleet and outsourcing a delivery fleet to a third-party provider:\nWhat is an Internal Delivery Fleet? Having an internal delivery fleet means operating a delivery service independently by using a dedicated in-house staff and a private fleet of vehicles to deliver all products or services to customers.\nIt gives you complete control over how you operate and manage the delivery service. This can be very useful when you want the freedom and flexibility to build a deep relationship with customers and provide a quality of service that\u0026rsquo;s consistent with your brand.\nAt the same time, it places your company at a greater risk. You take on the full responsibility of delivering goods or services safely and securely to your customers.\nIt also means that you cover the complete cost of running such a service, such as payroll expenses, the purchase, and maintenance of vehicles, implementation of route optimization software, etc.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not the end of the story.\nAs many small and medium companies, as well as large scale enterprises, swear by their decision to build internal fleets, it\u0026rsquo;s worth digging deeper.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at the advantages and disadvantages of owning and operating private fleets.\nThe Advantages of Private Delivery Fleets Complete Control Over Operations Building a private delivery fleet in-house means you get complete control over the entire delivery process. It gives you a free pass to shape the service around the company, and it makes it easier to plan around existing demands and future requirements.\nFor example, your current demands may have led you to establish a delivery service, but having an internal delivery fleet also opens up opportunities to expand beyond your existing market.\nAnother issue with external fleets can be the type of vehicles they own.\nAs most On-Demand companies operate standardized vehicles in their fleets, their limitations might hinder your delivery service if your demands exceed the capacities or capabilities.\nFor example, if you sell larger products like furniture or goods that require specially equipped vehicles for transport as in the food and drink industry.\nWith an in-house fleet, there is no such risk. You can simply buy or lease vehicles in your fleet and equip them based on the product or service specifications.\nIt’s also up to you to determine how you will manage delivery logistics. This ensures resources are spent and spread optimally across your service so it best serves existing operational capacities, budget limits, and the needs of your customers.\nMost importantly, though, you don’t have to rely on a third party to provide a complete customer experience. And that kind of independence can be very uplifting and liberating.\nFreedom and Flexibility The control that comes with having an internal delivery fleet, also means there is a lot of freedom and flexibility to determine the direction of your delivery service.\nMaybe you have a bad experience with local 3PL providers, or there aren’t any nearby companies that offer that kind of service. With an internal fleet, it doesn’t matter.\nOwning a delivery fleet makes you self-sufficient. That’s a great way to shape deliveries around product or service offerings, which can be more difficult with an external fleet.\nIf a third-party fleet restricts the types of products they deliver or simply don’t have the capacity, like, for example, delivering frozen foods, alcohol, or pharmaceuticals, having an internal fleet can be a real game-changer.\nNot only that, but very few outside fleets can handle unexpected deliveries.\nThe flexibility that comes with an internal fleet and the supporting infrastructure lets you schedule deliveries or re-route drivers as soon as orders arrive.\nAnd with an all-out service dedicated to delivering the best possible solution, you can get a jump on competitors and offer what nobody else is: customer value.\nCustomer-Oriented Service A big part of building and operating an internal fleet is that you get to recruit and train your own delivery workforce. The importance of this is something you can’t overlook since it has a real impact on customer service.\nAs you start bringing people into the delivery team, you get to instil them with the company philosophy, so everyone can get on the same page with your customer service practices.\nIt’s a great way to meet customer expectations if they are already used to a high-level level of care online or at your brick-and-mortar store.\nEven if you hire drivers from project to project, for example, they still have a deeper level of connection with the way you manage customer relationships than, say, a courier from UPS or DHL.\nAnd the deeper the commitment of your delivery fleet to the goals you are trying to achieve, the better the service your company will provide in the field.\nBrand Recognition and Awareness Advertising the company logo and colours on the side of your vehicles is a clear advantage of operating an internal fleet.\nThink of Coca-Cola, Walmart, and Amazon in the US, or Domino’s Pizza and Tesco in the UK. The branding on their trucks has become recognizable around the world. So much in fact that it can even spur real emotions in customers, as the case with Coca-Cola.\nAnd right from the start, it makes a real impact.\nFirst, it lets customers know you provide home delivery now, which can immediately boost sales since 66% of all consumers prefer home delivery to any other type of delivery.\nIt’s also a great way to maintain consistency in the brand offering, as you have full control over how the delivery service treats your customers. That can be especially important to loyal long-term customers.\nBut it also affects the way you are portrayed in the minds of potential new customers who are deciding between you and your competitors.\nEfficient Communication Another benefit of keeping the delivery service in house is that you exchange information within the fleet more efficiently.\nUnlike an external fleet, an internal fleet has the ability to remain connected throughout the lifecycle of a delivery. By using the same channels of communication, information can flow back and forth between managers and agents in the field.\nThis top-down and bottom-up flow of information means communication is faster while cutting out the middleman reduces reaction times.\nA manager can assign new stops to driver schedules as quickly as new delivery orders arrive. At the same time, drivers can relay changes from the field as they happen in real-time, and request support as it becomes necessary.\nNurturing customer relationships is equally important. So, operating deliveries with a centralized system of communication and alerts that can simplify that process is another factor that raises efficiency across the board.\nHaving an efficient network of communication like this greatly improves performance efficiency, which always has a positive effect on the bottom line.\nLower Costs Down the Line Let’s face it, creating a delivery fleet from nothing is an expensive venture. You need to buy vehicles and equipment, hire staff and cover payroll, build a supply chain, and automate the process using digital logistics software.\nAll of that requires a sizable investment of capital before you can hit the ground running.\nBe that as it may, it’s still a potentially worthwhile investment. With potentially better returns down the line than operating a delivery service using an external fleet.\nDespite all the monthly expenses (fuel, payroll, insurance, software subscriptions, etc.), you could potentially have significantly lower overhead costs when you operate an internal fleet. Depending on the stability of your volume level, of course. It might not seem that way at first glance until you take a look at how third party companies charge their services.\nDelivery as a Service and 3PL companies make their profit margin by selling their service as their main product and pricing it up appropriately above their costs. This could mean that the cost per delivery is significantly higher, particularly when you factor in all of the ‘extras’: surcharges, waiting time, etc.\nAt the other end of the scale, operating an internal fleet provides you flexibility around the delivery component.\nYou could potentially offer free delivery for example as you have full control over the associate cost structure. This might put your business at a significant competitive advantage.\nAssuming you have a steady enough base of demand, despite the upfront capital investment and ongoing costs (driver wages, fuel, etc.) you can generate healthy returns on operating an internal fleet - so long as you are optimizing your routes appropriately to minimize miles driven, etc.\nThe Disadvantages of Operating a Private Fleet High Initial Capital Requirements The biggest drawback of operating an in-house fleet is surely the heavy upfront investment costs necessary to build it.\nYou need to buy (or lease) vehicles and supporting equipment, hire drivers, develop a supply chain network, purchase insurance, and subscribe to digital logistics software to manage it all. All of it is necessary, but of course, has associated costs.\nYou also can’t expect all of this to happen overnight. You need to take into account the time it will take to procure everything which requires additional capital to support it.\nBesides the financial, physical, and human resources, you will also need to think about raising intellectual capital.\nDo you have enough logistics expertise and experience to operate a fleet independently? What about others on your team? How much will it cost to teach them and learn everything you need to know yourself?\nAll of this will require serious consideration before you set out to create your delivery fleet.\nSlow Scalability As fast and agile an in-house fleet can be when it comes to day-to-day operations, it is very cumbersome when you want to scale it.\nInitially, it will be easy to expand your operations. All you have to do is add additional drop-off locations, optimize their routes, and add them to your fleet’s delivery schedule. But what happens when your demand outgrows the size of your fleet?\nWhen that happens, you will need to increase your capacity. And that will require another round of investment.\nAs before, you will need to buy new equipment, hire and train staff, and integrate everything into the existing process. And when the need arises to scale again, the process will repeat itself.\nAt one point, you will have created a blueprint and the process would seem fast and easy. But when you compare it to contracting a bigger provider or fleet outsourcing to more than one company to meet increasing demand, how fast does scaling an internal fleet get?\nForward planning around your demand will be important as you think about how to scale your fleet and ensure it is always optimal as the scale of your operations will be very much a function of the route planning and optimization software that you decide to implement.\nComplete Liability What happens when something goes wrong during drop-off? When a package is damaged, or it arrives late? When the order is misplaced, or when it doesn’t arrive at all? How does it affect your reputation and service record? And who is liable for that?\nWhen you operate an internal delivery service, you take on all of the responsibility and risk for failed deliveries.\nWhile it doesn’t happen often, every time it happens it lowers your credibility among customers, which can have a serious impact on the bottom line.\nSince there is so much risk involved, even when you insure the service against unexpected events, the small scale and low reputation of your company will hinder you from getting a good rate.\nTo minimize that risk, you will have to have a sophisticated reverse logistics strategy and a responsive customer service team that enables you to handle those situations efficiently and with minimal cost to the company and effect on the brand image.\nOn the other hand, you can choose outsourcing courier services to an external fleet and let them take on all the liability and risk that comes with operating a delivery service.\nWhat is an External Fleet? Having an outside delivery fleet means outsourcing your last-mile delivery activities to a dedicated third-party service provider. The hired company is then responsible for delivering your products or services directly to the customer using its vehicles, equipment, facilities, and staff to do it, in return for a fee.\nBusinesses that provide this type of service tend to be Delivery as a Service, Third-Party Logistics (3PL), or Dedicated Courier companies.\nOutsourcing last-mile delivery like this is useful for companies that lack the necessary capital or know-how to build and manage an in-house fleet. So, there is also less risk involved, as well.\nInstead, a company can rely on a third party to provide a delivery service and focus its attention on core work activities, such as talking with customers, preparing orders, or developing products.\nAnd although the service fee of retail fleet outsourcing may potentially reduce profit margins, the minimal upfront cost and faster implementation can potentially drive greater overall revenue.\nThat’s why many companies starting up their delivery service usually choose to outsource the service. But to find out what else might influence your decision, here are the main benefits of an external fleet.\nThe Advantages of Outsourcing a Delivery Fleet Lower Initial Capital Requirements Fleet outsourcing the last-mile of delivery to a third-party provider is a lot more flexible since it requires little to no upfront costs to set up and usually involves pay-as-you-go service fees.\nFor many startups and companies that lack the necessary funds or expertise to build a fleet in-house or those with lumpy demand patterns, this often proves to be a more affordable, or at least more flexible, option.\nUsually, the only significant upfront investment needed to operate an outsourced fleet is an Order Management System, which allows you to connect incoming orders to the service provider’s fleet management, delivery and transport systems. Everything else is optional.\nMany third-party companies also have access to a wealth of contacts and resources, which they can use to gain much better deals on insurance or software subscription and make their service fees a lot more affordable.\nWith no significant investment to speak of, operating an external service also means the much faster implementation of your delivery service.\nFast Implementation Deliveries have become such an integral part of the shopping experience that the market size for last-mile delivery in North America alone is set to rise to almost 51 billion dollars by 2022.\nTo seize this opportunity, companies must create a delivery service quickly. Outsourcing a fleet to an outside partner is the fastest way to work around that problem.\nContracting your service to an external fleet is a great way to get the necessary resources and infrastructure to start delivering products or services to customers as soon as you’re ready.\nEven though this means raising the cost of delivery and renouncing a percentage of the delivery order, it’s a price many companies are willing to pay to get an operational delivery service within a short space of time.\nIt also means you can rely on the provider to gain access to a wealth of knowledge, tools, and best practices that would otherwise take years to accumulate, or might simply be out of reach.\nWith a fleet at your disposal at the earliest opportunity, you can become more competitive and increase your revenue potential, but also gain more time and freedom to focus on other areas of your business.\nGreater Focus on Core Activities Let’s face it, there are a lot of things to worry about when you own a business, and delivery service is just another activity that requires your attention.\nIf you’re new to it, planning, managing, and executing deliveries can take a real toll on other areas of your business unless you contract a provider.\nOutsourcing the fleet and the delivery side of your business to another company allows you to focus on the core activities of your business.\nWithout the need to spend time on the administrative burden involved with the managing of day-to-day tasks of a delivery fleet, you can zero in on other essential tasks like:\n customer relationship strategy; marketing and customer acquisition; service or product development; automation of the business; employee training and growth; capital management; accounting and financial management; financial and business analysis; quality and output performance.  Further, you gain access to the software solutions that the third-party logistics companies offer. Tools like digital logistics software, fleet management, and route optimization platforms serve the bottom line by ensuring maximum performance.\nFor example, routing optimization of third-party logistics operations can significantly reduce fuel consumption, tire wear and tear, and the need for vehicle maintenance.\nAdditionally, these companies also qualify for bigger discounts and lower rates, which means lower monthly overhead and even more resources you can use.\nMore flexibility Even though contracting an external fleet is potentially a more expensive option, it still allows you the flexibility of a fully variable set of costs vs. having a base of fixed costs of your own. This allows you to flex your spending in line with your own demand patterns.\nWhile an in-house fleet usually involves worrying about fuel, toll road, payroll, insurance payments, software subscriptions, and other operational costs, these are all part of the bundle you consume when you outsource a fleet to a third party company.\nProviders usually charge per delivery, per mile/kilometre, or the size of the shipped item, and charge it on an upfront or ongoing basis, depending on the agreement you have with them.\nAll unexpected expenses are the issue of the provider, which can include vehicle repairs, late fees, or the cost of returning failed deliveries.\nAlthough these costs are passed onto you as the customer, you are often protected by the agreement you originally signed which limits your exposure to anything beyond the course of normal business.\nPassing over the Liability Operating external carriers may involve less risk during delivery operations.\nAs dedicated providers become responsible for delivering products or services, they also take on all (or at least some) of the liability in case something happens, which might affect your customers or the company’s reputation and bottom line. This is usually covered by their insurance which is part of the package of services which you buy from the third party.\nFailed deliveries, misplaced or wrong orders, late arrivals, or damaged products en route are also often covered in some way, shape or form as part of the service.\nIn some of these instances, the third party might be liable and have to compensate the customer at no extra cost to your company. This is usually handled by the provider’s customer service department and initiating reverse logistics.\nProviders also remain responsible for unexpected events in the field that are out of their control, such as vehicle or equipment malfunction, unforeseen driver behaviour or health issues (like the state of delivery during the COVID-19 outbreak), or external disasters.\nAll of these situations are usually covered by the provider’s insurance policies, which cover everyone and everything involved during drop-off.\nHowever, it does highlight the importance of choosing a reliable and professional company with a good delivery track record. This way, you not only reduce liability for yourself but also provide the best possible service to your customers.\nThe Disadvantages of Outsourcing a Delivery Fleet Potential Erosion of Margins Despite the attraction of low initial capital requirements and fixed costs, outsourcing your logistics operations, especially with a stable and predictable volume and revenue base, can erode your operating margins.\nA company with an internal fleet is responsible directly for the associated costs, but they also have control over them. Therefore, they have the flexibility to be creative when pricing products or services to customers. For example, a company can offer free delivery as a value-add service to them.\nBy contrast, a company with an external fleet can’t operate with such flexibility as they have limited control over the cost structure of the provider.\nLess Control Over the Fleet Handing over part of your business to a third-party always involves relinquishing at least some control over those operations. When it comes to your delivery fleet, it is no different.\nUnlike an in-house delivery operation which retains total control over its staff and fleet, outsourcing the service to another company causes you to lose some of that control to the provider.\nIn agreement with you, the chosen company takes over the operations and the management of the entire delivery process. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to direct your service the way you want.\nIt also means that you have to rely on the contractor to maintain your standard of service. Sure you can bind them to an SLA, but without direct oversight, you cannot know whether their staff are making mistakes or delivering the same quality your customers are accustomed to.\nThat is a real problem for your company since customer experience has become the new battlefield for business, with 96% of all customers saying it is an important factor that determines their loyalty to a brand.\nLack of Communications Efficiency It’s hard enough to maintain efficiency in communications when all agents operate under one roof. But when channels are split between two organizations, the task becomes significantly more difficult.\nWorking with a third party raises the complexity of the communications network, reducing the flow of information and increasing the chance for misunderstanding.\nAs miscommunication between operators grows, harmony and teamwork are reduced within the fleet. Tensions can get high and lead to incoherence.\nIt also means that both organizations use different lines to communicate with one another.\nWhile information can flow directly up and down the line of communication within the external fleet, it has to flow indirectly between the fleet\u0026rsquo;s management and the company that hired it.\nSo even though the operations manager can issue tasks to drivers directly, and those drivers can relay back the information from the field, an in-house manager can’t make any requests directly to drivers. He has no direct link with them and has to rely on the external staff to pass his message along to the fleet.\nThis complex, indirect, and linear style of communication is a lot more time-consuming and can put a lot of pressure on decision-makers on both sides of the table. And when it involves time-sensitive deliveries, it usually results in substandard performance and output from the agents in the field.\nHowever, customers are the ones who will feel the biggest effect of poor communication, as it will lead to mistakes and failed deliveries. That can have a bad impact on their experience and cause your reputation to plummet, causing a blow to your bottom line.\nCan You Create a Hybrid Fleet? A hybrid delivery fleet involves combining features or elements of the internal and external fleet to gain a best-of-both-worlds scenario.\nEven though outsourcing services to a provider and managing an in-house fleet seem like two very different things that can’t work together, in reality, a hybrid can operate with even greater success as either model independently in some circumstances.\nCreating a mixed delivery fleet usually involves assembling a delivery operations team in-house (sometimes consisting of just one distribution manager) and giving them control of an external fleet (drivers and their vehicles).\nYou may also control the route optimization or delivery management software solution in this instance as well.\nThis kind of hybrid fleet is a great balance between an external fleet. First, it’s very useful for companies that may not want to buy equipment and vehicles, but possess the required human capital and experience to manage their delivery service and want to have more control vs. fully outsourcing everything.\nThe mixed workforce within a hybrid fleet streamlines communication while providing greater flexibility, control, and allowing more focus on core activities.\nWhat Are Your Company’s Needs? No two companies are exactly alike. What’s the right choice for your business, may not be the right choice for your competitors.\nOnly you can decide between operating an in-house fleet, outsourcing your delivery to a service provider, or creating a delivery service that combines internal and external fleets.\nAt first glance, it’s hard to see why every small-to-mid-sized business wouldn’t choose to outsource its services to a third-party provider. The company can start up its delivery service with minimal investment, yet gain access to a wealth of resources that it can use to effortlessly meet its demand.\nOn the other hand, there are a host of logical reasons (often centred around predictability of demand and a strong desire to preserve brand control) that can justify the human, financial, and intellectual capital required to build a private fleet, then it can be a worthwhile investment for that particular company.\nAt an enterprise level, similar dilemmas exist, it is always a trade-off between flexibility and control.\nThe key is to make the decision based on the needs and factors specific to your company, and the goals you wish to achieve.\nThat’s why one of the most underestimated factors when choosing between an internal and external fleet is the ability to execute a distribution and logistics operation shoulder to shoulder with your core business activities and gain advantages from it which outweigh the financial and time commitment.\nAfter all, delivery is complimentary to your core business - your customers are relying on it and it needs to work efficiently and at high quality. A lot of this will come down to how the operation is built and managed, the systems that are used, and the people that are involved in the operation (whether this is internal or external).

It might seem as though everything is going according to plan, that you are fulfilling enough orders to make returns, but then it turns out you are actually losing money at the end of each month.\nThe only way to know the state of your delivery is to use key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate various areas of your service.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s because numbers rarely lie.\nLast-mile delivery KPIs are windows into a business, its success, and efficiency, and can tell you the truth about your delivery operations.\nYou can measure the achievements of your delivery service using a powerful digital logistics solution to monitor a handful of key metrics. From how accurately or timely drivers pick up or drop off deliveries, to how efficiently operations managers spend and distribute resources.\nNot only does using KPIs in logistics let you take quantifiable steps to gauge the performance of your service, but it also allows you to find the strengths and weaknesses in your delivery logistics. And once you know that, you can take action to increase the effectiveness of the whole network and its output efficiency.\nSo, start measuring performance to get a better understanding of your delivery operations. Here are seven key logistics metrics that can help you:\n1. Number of Deliveries The number of completed deliveries of your products or services. Typically it is the sum of all deliveries within a month, quarter, or year.\nEven though it is an obvious metric to follow, it’s also the one by which all others will measure. It’s also the number that determines the effectiveness of the entire delivery operation.\nAnalysts also use it to calculate the average number of deliveries, which is useful to identify the potential for growth, especially when deliveries exceed or lag behind operational capacities.\n2. On-Time Delivery The number (or percentage) of deliveries carried out on time specified by the customer’s order, while the remaining figure points out late deliveries.\nOn-time delivery metrics provide a quick yes-or-no poll of the quality of the delivery service.\nFinding out which orders were delivered late helps operations managers work out the source of the problem, and address it. So, it\u0026rsquo;s worth taking a better look at when your agents and drivers complete their deliveries, and the best way is via the on-time delivery KPI.\n3. Order Accuracy The percentage of orders executed free of errors when compared against the total number of orders delivered. Also called the perfect order measurement, it lets you identify inaccuracies during the delivery process, either as failed deliveries, mistaken orders, returned, or damaged goods.\nThe order accuracy rate is calculated using this simple perfect order fulfilment formula:\nAn error order can occur at any point during fulfillment. That’s why it is frequently measured for the entire service as well as at each stage of the delivery process:\n Inventory forecasting; Procurement of products and services; Invoicing of delivery orders; Depot planning and pick-up; Transportation and drop-off.  Because inaccuracies can happen throughout the delivery lifecycle, it is difficult to track the accuracy rate as it relies on drivers, operations managers, or customers to report errors.\nOne way to work around this problem is to make it easier to submit reports. For example, implementing advanced logistics software helps operations managers detect errors in delivery because it gives customers the ability to rate and submit feedback about their experience.\n4. Transit Time to Distance The time drivers and couriers spend during transport from the pick-up site to the drop-off location.\nMeasuring the metric provides an overview of the speed of the agents in the field and the efficiency of their delivery routes.\nBut as drivers affect their routes, and routes affect the drivers on them, tracking this KPI is an unbiased way of maintaining the effectiveness of both.\n5. Vehicle Capacity vs. Available Capacity The capacity of a vehicle that delivers products or services relative to its total capacity. It shows the amount of idle space not used for order fulfillment, and to calculate it, all you have to do is divide the available capacity with the total capacity of a vehicle or fleet.\nMonitoring these last-mile delivery metrics is useful for vehicle management, as you can apply it across the fleet and use it to determine the profitability of your operations.\nWhen there is a high availability rate, this indicates inefficiencies in the loading procedure or the need to merge delivery routes. On the other hand, if the rate is low or negative, the capacity of the current delivery fleet is insufficient and demands expansion.\n6. Average Time Per Delivery The average time it takes to complete a delivery over a specific period. It offers insight into the effectiveness of the supply chain network, as well as the efficiency of the planned delivery routes.\nAlso called the average service time metric, you calculate it by dividing the total delivery time with the number across a predetermined interval (day/week/month/quarter/year).\nIt’s important to keep the number consistent. Too much ebb and flow can indicate issues that affect the delivery schedule.\nComparing different averages over equal periods helps managers root out problems by knowing which drivers they need to talk with or what routes to optimize.\n7. Average Cost of Delivery The average cost of delivering products or services based on specific key parameters. It is usually calculated based on distance (mile/kilometre), type of delivery (item), or type of vehicle.\nIn each case, the parameter determines how the cost will be measured. When it comes to distance the formula is:\nFor vehicle and delivery type the formula is somewhat different, as it needs to take into account the specific item or vehicle in question:\nCompanies can then use these averages to implement changes to the service, which might reduce its cost without affecting performance output, like using better vehicles or implementing route optimization software.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

This sudden spike in new customers has increased demand and placed a lot of strain on delivery services across the world.\nAnd as the pandemic persists, last-mile delivery continues to adapt and change its landscape to overcome the unexpected challenges brought on by the coronavirus.\nAn Overnight Surge in Delivery Demand In response to the pandemic, governments around the world have passed restrictive measures to raise social distancing.\nAlthough every country is handling the situation differently, all of them are urging their citizens to stay at home in an attempt to slow down the spread of the virus.\nConfined to their homes, people now rely almost entirely on home delivery. What was once a convenience has become a necessary way to purchase and receive goods.\nThe quarantine has affected businesses, too.\nUnder the current circumstances, many companies either operate in a limited capacity or have halted their operations altogether.\nThose businesses that remain open have had to adapt to how they sell their end product, be it goods or services, as well as how they receive supplies. In both cases, they depend exclusively on a delivery system.\nThe sudden surge of new customers means the demand for delivery services has skyrocketed overnight.\nFor companies that have provided a delivery service in the past, it is a great opportunity to advance in the market and bolster their bottom line. For others, it means catching up with the changing landscape and offering home delivery to their customers.\nAs a result, the demand for delivery services is higher now more than ever, and at every level.\nDelivery Capacities Pushed to Their Limits High demand requires an equally high capacity from the supply of delivery services. Otherwise, it comes under a lot of stress to meet it.\nIn 2019, online sales accounted for just 10% of all retail sales in the United States according to the U.S. Census Bureau. For many other countries, that percentage is certainly even lower.\nNow imagine, if that remaining 90 % of in-store purchases also had to be completed online, and then delivered to their drop-off locations.\nThe problem wouldn’t be with long-distance shipments moved across the global transportation network and dropped off at a single location. The problem would arise during the last mile of the delivery when each one has to reach the doorstep of the customer.\nWhile it isn’t exactly the scenario currently unfolding, that’s what delivery services are potentially facing around the world due to the spike in demand for home delivery caused by COVID-19.\nGreater Safety Measures Than Ever Before When there is so much pressure put on packing, shipping, and delivery workers, companies need to remember that their safety and the safety of their customers must come first.\nWith that in mind, companies that offer a delivery service need to follow and comply with the safety guidelines issued by the World Health Organization, as well as their respective national health agencies.\nIt is essential to inform customers about the new procedures and make them aware of the safety measures they need to take during this time.\nWhat’s even more important during the current COVID-19 outbreak is to limit contact between people, and using delivery logistics software can be very helpful with that.\nAdvanced platforms have a system of notifications that can automatically alert customers when their package is near. It gives them enough time to plan how they want to pick up the delivery or provide details where they want the courier to leave the parcel before it arrives.\nQuality of Service Remains Key During these trying times, large numbers of deliveries, and new safety measures can push your service capabilities to its limits. But even now, it is vital to maintain a high level of service quality.\nHopefully, this situation won’t last too long. When things return to normal, most of your new customers will want to continue using your services. And if you provide a memorable experience to them, it raises the chances of doing exactly that.\nMany customers are still new to the concept of online shopping and home delivery, especially when it comes to items that they usually buy at brick-and-mortar shops such as food and drink.\nThat means they still may be in between brands. The delivery service you offer might be exactly the difference that tips the scale in your favor.\nMaking sure your business continues to make deliveries quickly, accurately, on time, and without damage can all raise the value of your service in your customers' eyes.\nBut seeing how these new circumstances dictate how you operate the delivery service, it might also help to look at ways to optimize it for extra efficiency.\nOptimization Is No Longer a Choice The way you used to manage and operate last-mile delivery before the COVID-19 outbreak may have been sufficient at the time, but the different landscape (and the challenges that arrive with it) requires inventiveness.\nAs social distancing raises demands, putting more pressure on your delivery service, running operations more efficiently is the key to maximize the number of deliveries you can take on.\nThe key is automation.\nCompanies that were using fleet management, tracking, and route optimization software before the pandemic had started are handling the current delivery demand much easier.\nThe use of software allows them to be much more agile when it comes to how they schedule, plan, and execute deliveries. It goes without saying how important that is now when orders are arriving round the clock, while resources are spread thinly.\nHaving a central hub that can receive orders, send them out, and track them in the field also helps in case a driver unexpectedly gets infected and starts showing symptoms during drop-off.\nIn case that happens, a driver can simply contact the operations manager to get to the nearest hospital for treatment, while the manager can react immediately and re-route other vehicles in the fleet to pick up and drop off the remaining deliveries.\nWhat’s Next? So much depends on delivery right now. The role it plays in the lives of your customers can’t be underestimated. It is proving to be a vital tool in the fight against COVID-19.\nBut the effects cut both ways. As such, the consequences of the pandemic have reshaped the landscape of last-mile delivery.\nIt has taken a global pandemic to completely turn people’s perception of delivery, from the convenience of a few to a potentially new way of doing things. But it has also revealed major weaknesses in the current system.\nBy raising demand, the coronavirus has exposed the limits of existing capacities, underlined the need to automate and optimize, and highlighted even more than before the importance of service quality.\nFor companies that meet these challenges head-on and successfully overcome them, the possibilities are endless. And when the quarantine is lifted, their future looks bright.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

The fastest one? The one with the least traffic, maybe? Or is it because you can pick up a cup of coffee on your way to work?\nIt is probably all of those things and more. All of those reasons make it the best possible route to reach your destination. In this case, the office.\nWhen it comes to delivering goods or services, the logic is the same.\nA delivery fleet has to use the best route to each customer using the least amount of time and resources to complete a delivery.\nBut unlike simply reaching point A from point B, delivery fleets have a lot more stops to make. Even with shorter runs, the number of factors and variables that determine the best route remains incredibly high.\nNot to mention, all of the constraints of running a route, like pickup locations, driver schedules, customer demands, and many others. All of them make finding the optimal delivery route an extremely complex ordeal, too.\nPlus, a delivery route is never the same. Unlike your way to work, it never occurs under the same set of circumstances.\nSo even when you come up with an ideal path from point A, to point B, all the way to point Z, you still have another round of route planning once new orders pour in.\nPut it all together, and you have a real logistical puzzle on your hands.\nSo, what do you do in a situation like this? What do you do when you want to determine the best route (and the best use of those hard-earned resources)?\nYou turn to route optimization.\nWhat is route optimization? Route Optimization is the process of establishing the most cost-effective route between multiple locations. It makes the best use of available resources to reach each destination in the shortest time. It takes into account key factors to achieve this, such as the number of stops and the distances between them.\nSometimes, the process is mistaken as routing, route scheduling, or route planning. But the process goes beyond that. It’s far more comprehensive.\nTo be truly cost-effective, route optimization takes into account other relevant factors to determine the optimal route, like:\n Types of roads (urban vs. highways; single lanes vs. multi lanes; one-way vs. two-way); Traffic patterns (traffic congestions at a specific time of day, detours, roadblocks); Number of turns, intersections, traffic lights, and roundabouts; Crossing the line of traffic (left-hand turns in the US; right-hand turns in the UK); Pickup times (of products, equipment, or service workers); Depot locations; Best access point to the stop; Closest or best-suited driver on the route to pick up and drop off; Driver schedules; Vehicle type and their cargo capacities; Delivery times (delivery by the specified time, regular deliveries, urgent deliveries, etc.).  Therefore, it’s not enough to simply know where a driver is heading, but where will they pick up, what will they encounter on their way to a stop, how long will it take to reach the destination, and by what time do they have to arrive. Not to mention, who the driver is, and whether they are driving a van or a trailer truck.\nEven without all of these constraints, there are far too many options to choose from. For example, a single vehicle in your fleet which needs to make 10 stops has over 1, 2, or sometimes 3 million possible routes. That’s before you take into account any of the factors.\nBut to be truly efficient, you need to include those into your calculation, as well. And all of this has to happen on every single delivery run in your entire fleet!\nLuckily, there is a solution. It’s called route optimization software.\nWhat is Route Optimization Software? Route optimization software is a digital technology used to automatically calculate the most efficient paths between a series of stops for a vehicle fleet. It uses a set of complex algorithms to factor in multiple constraints and determines a route that is efficient, cost-effective and meets customer and stakeholder demands.\nTraditionally, delivery service planners relied on manual route planning. They would only use maps, splitting them into zones and visually planning routes based on the shortest distance between two stops (without factoring in anything else). This might seem efficient, but it isn’t.\nSo, when they wanted to increase the efficiency of their delivery routes, the process became simply impossible to do manually.\nWhy Do You Need Route Optimization Software? As technology improved, software and logistics experts came up with an enhanced approach to solving VPR using computer algorithms. This was the first step in creating route optimization software as we know it today.\nNowadays, route optimization software is an umbrella term used for a number of automated actions this type of software is able to perform.\nFirst, this technology is always connected to the Internet. Software like this can access a vast amount of data necessary to factor in every conceivable external constraint and make split-second calculations.\nFor example, route optimization software has access to GPS maps. This allows it to use precise maps when locating stops and delivery addresses, so it can create accurate routes. In turn, this minimizes the chance of failed deliveries, or missed stops.\nBeyond that, it can access traffic systems in real-time. This can then be used to establish routes with the least amount of traffic or provide dispatchers with actionable live operations data which can be used to help drivers in the field. Thus, reducing costs on fuel consumption and driver overtime.\nBefore, this type of software, delivery managers relied on multiple disconnected digital tools to complete the same tasks. Now, every segment of planning, optimization, and execution of the delivery lifecycle is located on one platform.\nBesides reducing the manpower necessary to plan and schedule delivery routes, it also streamlines the process. With the route optimization software in place, a business can manage its depots and fleets, and dispatch drivers from one central location. Improving communication and visibility.\nBut there are even more benefits of route optimization software to look forward to.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

It’s the most important thing to consider when offering a quality delivery service to customers.\nSure, you need vehicles and storage facilities to carry out operations. But good logistics are to delivery operations what the mind is to our bodies – an essential part of a whole.\nIt lets you create an efficient symbiosis with the transportation network so your operations can run effectively. And getting it right is the bane of all companies and their delivery services.\nLike with everything, the first step is key. It all starts with a plan. But how you lay out that plan is far more important than just having one!\nWhen talking about product or service delivery operational layouts, there are two ways to go about it:\n Planning at a depot (facility) level, or; Centralized multi-depot planning.  Both aim to overcome the same logistical challenges, like finding optimal delivery routes, increasing speed and efficiency, minimizing operational costs, and maximizing the use of resources. But only one type of planning is right for you, and your path to success and scalability.\nHere to help overcome these challenges is an overview of planning at a depot level versus a more centralized system.\nThe Capabilities of Planning at a Depot Level Depot level planning is a type of delivery logistics where each depot is managed independently. This way of organizing operations provides greater autonomy and flexibility, as each hub is responsible for planning, scheduling, and executing incoming orders by managing its own resources.\nRunning operations at a depot level require each facility to have a skilled staff that can successfully manage, communicate, and carries out its activities simultaneously with other depots without hindering them. As a result, the two main issues with this type of planning are usually cost and communication.\nThat’s why planning at a depot level is best suited for small businesses with smaller fleets and a few depot locations.\nLet’s take a look at two independently-managed depots. Both sites fleets which are managed by their own teams who receive orders, schedule deliveries, and plan out their routes. Thus, there is a lot less communication and overlap, and both facilities can thrive on the main advantages of the system – autonomy andcontrol at a depot level.\nBy contrast, planning at the depot level becomes more complicated logistically speaking when applied to a larger scale. Even when scaled to three depots with 10 vehicles each, the task of organizing operations is considerably more complicated with substantial loss of efficiency.\nThe first significant problem is route planning. It becomes much more difficult to create delivery routes for individual vehicles as each one needs to reach more stops efficiently, while other planning variables and required constraints are also increasing exponentially.\nThe second problem is resource management. As you increase the number of depot sites, you need to hire more people to manage those facilities when you plan activities at a depot level. If you scale up to ten depots, you need to hire ten service managers or dispatchers, or both, to manage your entire operations.\nFinally, communication is much more difficult when planning at a depot level. Whenever you increase the number of people working on operation, there is more of a chance for miscommunication. And when that happens, it is impossible to effectively coordinate activities between teams.\nThat’s why if you’re just introducing a delivery service as part of your offer, start planning it at a depot level. As you grow your service and create a need to scale it, you can easily transition to a centralized planning system that is better suited to large scale operations.\nThe Advantages of Centralized Multi-Depot Delivery Planning Centralized multi-depot planning is a type of delivery logistics planning where every part of the operation is managed from one central hub. This gives planners an overview of all orders, activities, and resources to comprehensively plan and schedule pickup and delivery routes for the entire fleet.\nAs with single-depot planning, the success of the centralized system relies on a quality communication network. But unlike the previous model where communication is horizontal, in this type of planning information flows vertically.\nIn a centralized delivery scenario, a single team is responsible for organizing the entire delivery lifecycle. Once a plan is in place, the schedule is dispatched down the line to all depots and fleet drivers. Likewise, the teams in the field can relay information up the chain, back to the central hub.\nThe two-way flow of information is simpler and allows managers to monitor progress on each delivery. They can make adjustments to the initial plan to overcome unforeseen events, or include new deliveries to the schedule and plan routes as they come in on the Order Management System (OMS).\nHaving a centralized planning system in place also enables teams in the main hub to optimize their plans day to day, to streamline every delivery route. As a result, this can in time increase efficiency and reduce operational costs of running a delivery service.\nThat’s why small-to-medium organizations and large-scale enterprises use centralized delivery planning to plan and manage their fleets and multi-depot networks.\nHow to Move a Plan into Action? Even though each type of logistics planning has appeal in a specific context, there is a way to improve both methods and apply either one of them successfully to your organization.\nThe solution is to use a powerful multi-depot delivery routing and scheduling software.\nUnlike traditional planning methods that rely on a host of disconnected systems, a multi-depot SaaS solution takes centralized planning to another level.\nIt lets you apply the centralized way of planning delivery to multiple, as well as a single depot, and gives you the ability to plan, manage and optimize all of your operational activities in one place.\nOne team can easily take into account all operational parameters at once to plan each delivery with an unprecedented level of detail:\n time windows; driver schedules and shifts; different product or service offers; product categories (ambient, frozen, fragile, etc.); vehicle type and capacity; vehicle capabilities (detachable trailers, lifting equipment, etc.); drivers and their specific skills; security requirements (e-signatures, barcodes, etc.); customer feedback.  To achieve this, the multi-depot software solution integrates all tools into one system. From an OMS and routing optimization software to delivery scheduling and digital proof of delivery.\nAs a result, you receive the benefits of planning at a depot level (detail-oriented planning and flexibility), as well as the advantages of centralized multi-depot planning (easy communication and streamlined operational management).\nBest of all, the entire plan is optimized for efficient resource use and distribution to reduce cost and maximizes effectiveness, visibility, speed, and control.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

No more pen and paper, or spreadsheets!\nField service management tools allow organizations to fully automate their service lifecycle, as the end-to-end solution to everything from operational and workforce management, to ensuring customer expectations.\nSuccessful implementation of Field Service Management Software starts with an understanding of what it is, what it can do, and how it might help you drive efficiency in specific areas of your field service operations.\nWhat Is Field Service Management Software? Field service management (FSM) software is a digital solution that automates the process of operating service teams in the field.\nIt provides managers with relevant data to plan, organize, track, and optimize technicians’ activities to maximize their effectiveness and productivity.\nThe software can either be Cloud-Based or On-Premise. Cloud-Based software is the most common choice among companies in today\u0026rsquo;s fast-paced environment, due to the ability to pay monthly (Software as a Service) vs. paying upfront all the costs involved with a perpetual license.\nCloud-based field service software is also always up to date ensuring that your business is never behind the curve.\nWith FSM software in place, service managers have complete oversight of all operations from one central location.\nThey can then act on information coming directly from the field, and adjust operations when necessary and in real-time.\nService managers can also rely on a number of other capabilities of field service management software to streamline other areas of the service process that can help technicians carry out their work:\n Route optimization to reduce the time it takes to reach the next service location with the least possible resources; Flexible task scheduling to ensure their realization (scheduled services vs. last-minute calls, etc.) of complicated or dynamic customer requests; Mobile field service management to select the right technicians for a specific job; Vehicle management to ensure the right vehicles with the correct equipment are selected for relevant jobs; Storing customer information to ensure specific operational details relevant to a particular customer are stored clearly for the best field service delivery; Real-time updates to ensure every stakeholder is always in the loop via real-time updates and alerts Ratings and feedback to gain actual insight into the customer experience.  Field Service Management software solutions also provide access to necessary information for everyone involved in the service process to execute their activities.\nTechnicians can easily receive input in the field on their mobile apps, while automatic synchronization gives managers complete transparency to make data-driven decisions at every stage of the lifecycle.\nThe interconnectedness between service managers and field technicians improves their communication and cooperation and thus driving efficiency.\nThis creates a field service management system that directly benefits the entire lifecycle of the service from operational and workforce performance, to customer satisfaction.\nStrategic Implementation of FSM Software Implementing the best field service management software doesn’t require a lot of time.\nIn many cases, new tools can fully integrate with existing systems within 24 hours, but there needs to be an element of planning involved before that.\nTaking a strategic approach ensures the successful implementation of FSM tools and an easy transition for everyone in the company who will use the new system.\nAnd while there are many ways to go about this, there are a few key steps you can take to create a winning strategy.\n#1 Start with a Trial Don’t rush into automation for automation’s sake!\nThere are a lot of SaaS and traditional on-premise vendors that offer field service management platforms. So, it’s worth the effort to consult your workforce before coming to a decision.\nConsult your managers and field technicians to learn what features would be useful to them, since they are the ones running the day-to-day operations.\nBefore purchasing the software, book a demo to see what you are buying. Better yet, find a provider that offers a trial version.\nPlacing the potential new tool in the hands of key operational personnel permits them to make a genuine assessment of the situation, and let you make the right call.\n#2 Allow Time for Training Adopting new technology is not accomplished overnight.\nEven with a handful of technicians who will get the chance to work with the trial version, there will still be a lot more to learn once the software is up and running.\nSetting aside time and resources for a training period is a smart way to teach staff how to use the latest technological investment.\nStart with tutorials and explainer videos.\nAfter people get a better sense of what the software can do, you can initiate peer-to-peer training to teach more advanced features.\nOnce enough people have completed their training, let them use the software in real-life scenarios, and let your operations managers notify you when it’s time to make the complete switch to automated field service management.\n#3 Anticipate Systems Integration and Data Flows The final step is to consider the integration process.\nThink about what you are using now to manage the field service.\nDo you rely on paper for service orders and invoices?\nOr do you use spreadsheets or other software packages?\nHow do you currently use and store data?\nYou should have answers to all of these when looking for a digital field service management solution.\nAnd while each FSM platform is different, there are multiple integration solutions to choose from.\nThe easiest way is to automatically connect your internal CRM system through an API.\nSome field service software, like this one, allows you to import (and export) customer information in bulk.\nThis is usually done via CSV files.\nApart from automatic integration, you should always have the option to manually upload information into the system.\nOnce you have a full grasp of how the integration will look like, you should prepare all the files from your end and anticipate an easy system integration within 24 hours.\nAnd we can help you with all of this.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.

Businesses that plan routes manually are usually highly dependent on one or a small team of people with entrenched working knowledge of distribution and particularly the geographical area in which distribution is taking place.\nWithout this key person operations quickly start to “fall apart”, the business “doesn’t know what they would do without him / her” etc. This person is the bridge between distribution businesses and their customers – they know what customers like, do not like, which drivers like certain routes vs. others, which vehicles are needed for certain job types etc. The challenge is that all of this information is held in one person’s head and it cannot be used in any kind of repeatable or scalable way. Further, what appears optimal on the surface (a smooth curve on a map etc.) as a result of it having been done that way for many years is likely actually not optimal in practice when it comes to distance driven, driver hours etc.\nOrders / tasks enter the process often as print outs or orders received via an order management system. At that point somebody, often the route planner above sorts through the orders, groups them into service areas, postcodes etc. and then adds any particular ‘special requirements’ or exceptions on top – many of these are anecdotal in nature i.e. this is a big customer and therefore we should visit them before 10am because the sales team said it would be a good idea.\nRecurring orders are generally part of ‘fixed routes’ – a topic worthy of spending a bit of time on individually…\nSo what are ‘fixed routes’ Fixed routes are a sequence of drops / pickups which involves visiting the same locations on a recurring basis (i.e. daily, weekly etc.) – sometimes customers do not require visits and sometimes other tasks could be slotted into these routes. The challenge is with ‘fixed routes’ is that optimisation opportunities between different vehicles, drivers etc. will certainly be missed and at any kind of scale this means that there is quite a bit of waste when it comes to miles driven etc.\nThat said, many businesses operate fixed routes as a key component of their customer service strategies with the same driver visiting the same customers and getting to know them etc. and as a result they consciously sacrifice some of the margin that they know is on the table. The reality is that probably a balance between certain elements of a route being fixed and certain areas of a route being dynamic and adjustable daily, weekly etc. around the master plan would lead to the best all-round outcome for these types of businesses.\nWhat about drivers? How do they go about executing these manually planned routes? Often, lack of technology in the office (in terms of planning delivery routes) usually is a strong indicator for lack of technology in the cabs of vans, trucks etc. As a result drivers are usually provided run-sheets or pieces of paper on which they have the product that needs to be delivered and the location etc. They will then regularly rely on their own knowledge to put the individual stops into an order that they feel is optimal and will start driving. When the driver is delivering the items along their self-determined route, there will in most cases be no visibility over where he/she is or how he/she is performing against their plan (i.e. will all these deliveries be able to be made on time?).\nIn some cases, businesses might be using simple route planning software that doesn’t take into account enough operational variables or spreadsheets which have been created by the routing and planning team (which generally are a continuation of the ‘knowledge in head’ phenomenon which we discussed above combined with a few constraints i.e. when should this driver end their shift etc.\nSophisticated cloud-based route planning software looks at a whole multitude of operational constraints and parameters all in one go (capacities, dimensions, product mixes, particular regulations, required driver skills or vehicle requirements etc.) and therefore allows for an always-optimal route to be produced (either from scratch, or through the tightening up of a master plan as it gets closer to the point of actual execution). Further, sophisticated routing and scheduling algorithms are also looking into traffic, historical patterns around service duration at particular stop points etc. to ensure that routes are practically executable by drivers as well.\nI get it… but I’ve been doing this manual planning for a long time and it works, is it really so bad? While orders have been getting to customers and drivers have been showing up to work, executing routes etc. likely a lot of value has already been left on the table.\nSome of the value left on the table might come in the form of:\n Inefficient decisions made by drivers – dropping X off before Y might seem like a good idea because your driver has done it this way for a long time and must know but there are a whole host of motivations which will likely drive the sequence of drops decided by drivers, few of which will have to do with which is the most optimal in terms of miles driven etc. Priorities being set on particular customers by sales teams – things occasionally go wrong with customers. Particularly if you are operating in an extremely competitive or commoditised industry, you might fear if you don’t agree to their every demand your customers might walk out of the door. The reality is that you likely will provide your customers the best service if your business runs efficiently and you are able to make money. As a result, it is likely a short-term sticking-plaster to change things around one customer… instead create a repeatable service value which takes their needs (and 100s like them) into account Driving blind and lacking insight – without any visibility over how drivers are executing plans and where they are on their routes it becomes difficult to keep customers informed when things inevitably do happen on the road. Also it becomes very difficult to learn from mistakes and spot areas for improvement. As the saying goes if it cannot be measured, it cannot be managed. Too much influence and control with too few people – one day the leader of your routing team will retire and as a result all of their knowledge will leave with them if you do not have a scalable and repeatable process in place. Inability to scale beyond a certain point - there are a maximum number of tasks that a manual routing team can handle without the assistance of sophisticated routing and planning software. This also translates to the customer service team who without visibility over what is happening in the field struggle to answer questions from customers (in terms of delivery times etc.) and the problem compounds  Could manual route planning be holding back your business? A team empowered with powerful tools which are able to be ‘tweaked’ or adjusted based on their knowledge is likely a winning combination when it comes to staying ahead.\nWe have everything you need to start improving your delivery.\nHere are the nine free guides that will show you exactly what we do to optimize the last mile and dominate delivery logistics.\n1.
