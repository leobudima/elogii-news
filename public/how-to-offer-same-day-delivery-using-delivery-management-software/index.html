          <p>In this new post, you’ll take a closer look at how you can offer same-day delivery to your customers using delivery management software.</p>
<p>You’ll also see why it matters to them in the first place, and what you can do to make it a reality for your organization.</p>
<p>Plus, you’ll get a chance to try out one solution straight away.</p>
<p>(But more on that later)</p>
<p>Right now, if you want to learn how to increase the speed and efficiency of your delivery to include same-day delivery, read on.</p>
<p>Let’s jump right in.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-same-day-delivery-matter-to-your-customers">Why does same-day delivery matter to your customers?</h2>
<p><a href="https://elogii.com/blog/same-day-delivery-and-delivery-management-software/" title="same day delivery and delivery management software"><strong>Same-day delivery and delivery management software</strong></a> have revolutionized the way consumers shop.</p>
<p>From a customer’s point of view, faster delivery is all about convenience. To support this, PwC did <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/consumer-markets/consumer-insights-survey.html"><strong>a survey on customer experience</strong></a>.</p>
<p>First, they found that <strong>convenience</strong> and the <strong>shopping experience</strong> are the main driving forces that motivate consumers to choose a specific brand.</p>
<p>Far more than the price of their products or services.</p>
<p>And second, the survey also found that <strong>consumers want greater speed when shopping online</strong>.</p>
<p>So much in fact, that <strong>88% of consumers</strong> don’t mind paying an additional fee if it means they will receive their order faster.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Travel%20Transport%20and%20Logistics/Our%20Insights/Same%20day%20delivery%20the%20next%20evolutionary%20step%20in%20parcel%20logistics/Sameday_delivery_The_next_evolutionary_step_in_parcel_logistics.ashx"><strong>A report by McKinsey</strong></a> sums up the benefits of same-day delivery nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It integrates the convenience of online retail with the immediacy of brick and mortar stores.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From an operational point of view, faster delivery is all about automation.</p>
<p><strong>Without software to plan, manage, and optimize your delivery, it is almost impossible to offer same-day delivery to your customers.</strong></p>
<p>And even then it is difficult to do it.</p>
<p>But if <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/the-state-of-delivery-in-time-of-the-coronavirus/" title="the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus"><strong>the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus</strong></a> has shown us anything, it’s that customers want fast home delivery.</p>
<p>So, if you can start offering same-day delivery to local customers, the rewards far outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>And technology can get you there.</p>
<p>Here’s how:</p>
<h2 id="get-the-right-order-information-before-planning-the-delivery">Get the right order information before planning the delivery.</h2>
<p>An order is the primary source of data for each delivery.</p>
<p><strong>It’s critical to accurately include the right information when planning routes around each order.</strong></p>
<p>Otherwise, drivers can get lost trying to find the correct destination.</p>
<p>They can spend valuable time fixing one mistake while creating a whole host of others down the line.</p>
<p>In the worst-case scenario, their efforts may be in vain.</p>
<p>They can just as easily miss their target destination completely while holding up other deliveries and missing ETAs for the entire route.</p>
<p>All of that can be averted before they set off on the route.</p>
<p>Human error is behind all these mistakes.</p>
<p>While people are important for operating technology, whatever you do to minimize their involvement can raise the efficiency and accuracy of your efforts.</p>
<p>So if you plan to offer same-day delivery, you need to ask yourself: <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/are-you-still-planning-manually/" title="are you still planning manually"><strong>are you still planning manually?</strong></a></p>
<p>Even if you have moved from pen and paper to software to manage orders, it still doesn’t mean that you have automated the planning process.</p>
<p>In all probability, you are using a host of disconnected apps and manually typing in information onto a screen.</p>
<p>So, the question <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/to-centralize-or-not-to-centralize-delivery/" title="to centralize or not to centralize delivery"><strong>to centralize or not to centralize delivery</strong></a> is an important one.</p>
<p>While there are advantages to decentralization, a centralized delivery management system can do a lot more for automating the planning process.</p>
<p><strong>First, modern software solutions can interconnect.</strong></p>
<p>You can use <strong>API integration</strong> to link your order management system, for example, your Shopify account, with your delivery planning software.</p>
<p>So when an order arrives, all of the information is automatically added to the <strong>delivery platform</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are using Excel, you can <strong>export orders as a .csv file</strong> and use <strong>bulk upload</strong> to add all of them into the system all at once.</p>
<p>Once the right information is accessible, your route planners can create routes and map them out digitally using <strong>route planning software</strong>, <strong>geolocation</strong>, and <strong>GPS</strong>.</p>
<p>With a digital map at their disposal, drivers won’t have any problem finding the right address.</p>
<p>On the off chance the address is wrong, a driver can ask customer support to contact the customer and reschedule the delivery.</p>
<p>Having all the right information about the customer, their order, and delivery preferences in one place also make it easier for you and your drivers to provide a better customer experience.</p>
<h2 id="ensure-drivers-have-enough-time-with-customers">Ensure drivers have enough time with customers.</h2>
<p>Despite the need for speedy delivery, <strong>customers still crave human interaction</strong>.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it’s critical to give drivers enough time to talk to your customers.</p>
<p><strong>Drivers and field agents are the face of your brand.</strong></p>
<p>Letting them have a friendly conversation with the customer lets them make a good first impression.</p>
<p><strong>It also builds relationships.</strong></p>
<p>Customers usually have a product or service-related question.</p>
<p>At other times, they need help bringing in a package inside their homes.</p>
<p>If a driver has an extra 5-10 minutes in his schedule to help, it will prompt customers to place more trust in them.</p>
<p><strong>When you create schedules using software, you can easily allocate that time to each drop-off.</strong></p>
<p>Without risking the timeliness of the entire delivery route, you ensure reliability and accuracy and add a personal touch to your service.</p>
<p>As a result, <strong>your brand will seem more trustworthy</strong>.</p>
<p>And if customers start attaching emotions to your organization, they will start seeing it more as a person (via your drivers) than a company.</p>
<p>For example, that’s why many people don’t particularly like Amazon delivery.</p>
<p>Because of the speed of fulfilment, Amazon drivers don’t have time to interact with customers.</p>
<p>In most cases, they either leave the delivery at the door or have time for a brief encounter.</p>
<p>Something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Amazon Fulfillment.</em></p>
<p><em>Delivery for Mr. Smith.</em></p>
<p><em>Please sign here.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you.</em></p>
<p><em>Bye.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The introduction of fulfilment lockers, drones, and unmanned vehicles will make it even more difficult in the future.</p>
<p>This does give you a valuable opportunity to stand out.</p>
<p>With more focus on nurturing customer relationships, you can gain a competitive edge and you will know <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-compete-with-amazon-delivery/" title="how to compete with Amazon delivery"><strong>how to compete with Amazon delivery</strong></a>.</p>
<p>All it takes is an extra few minutes in your driver’s delivery schedule.</p>
<h2 id="increase-the-visibility-over-your-operations">Increase the visibility over your operations.</h2>
<p>What happens when drivers set off on their routes?</p>
<p>Do they drop off orders on time?</p>
<p>Or do they miss those windows?</p>
<p>Why does that happen?</p>
<p>And what about the delivery itself?</p>
<p>Why does the customer want to return it?</p>
<p>Why is he or she unsatisfied with your service?</p>
<p>Without software and visibility over your operations, you may never know the answers to these questions.</p>
<p><strong>That’s because most deliveries that don’t use software leave a lot of the decision-making up to their teams on the ground.</strong></p>
<p>After a driver leaves the depot for his route, all managers can do is cross their fingers and hope for the best.</p>
<p>And with something as dynamic as same-day delivery at stake, it isn’t very reliable to have little to no overview of the last mile of the operation.</p>
<p>But delivery management software can help you here.</p>
<p>In the same way geolocation and GPS allow you to <strong>map routes with multiple stops</strong>, the system lets you <strong>track driver (or delivery) location on that same map in real-time</strong>.</p>
<p>This gives you more control over the last mile.</p>
<p>Dispatch teams can track and monitor drivers as they move along their routes and follow up on their schedules and ETAs.</p>
<p>If a driver is delayed or misses a stop, managers can contact them to find out the reason and react to the situation.</p>
<p>If it’s beyond your control, for example, traffic congestion on the road, dispatch can <strong>reroute the driver and revise the ETA</strong> so the customer is aware of the delay.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if, for example, a vehicle breaks down, you can immediately dispatch the closest driver to pick up the load and send a repair team to fix or tow the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>Planners and managers can use driver tracking capabilities to plan routes and deliveries on the go.</strong></p>
<p>As soon as an order arrives, the planner can look at the map, evaluate the fleet, and assign the task to the best driver based on that information.</p>
<p>He can then add a stop at the depot site and the new drop-off point, while the software recalibrates the new route.</p>
<p>And since the system automatically updates the new information, the driver can access his app, see the change, and quickly pick-up the order.</p>
<p>Then, he can continue along his route without too much interruption while he drives.</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>delivery management software allows you to send out tracking links to customers</strong>.</p>
<p>This raises the transparency of your service and their orders.</p>
<p>The customer can access the link to check the date and time of arrival, and arrange his or her day accordingly.</p>
<p>There is less chance of a missed or failed delivery, and if there is a delay, the customer will be aware of it.</p>
<p>All of this ensures the maximum speed, efficiency, and quality of service with each delivery.</p>
<p>Now it’s your turn to decide. Will you offer same-day delivery to your customers?</p>
