        <div class="content mb-5">
          <p>This is a definitive guide to choosing route optimization software.</p>
<p>In this new guide for 2020, you’ll find out everything you need to know about picking out the best tool for your company, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://elogii.com/blog/what-is-route-optimization-and-why-you-need-it/"><strong>What is route optimization software</strong></a> and what it’s for (in the first place);</li>
<li>How does route optimization work;</li>
<li>What’s wrong with manually planning routes;</li>
<li>How does route optimization software benefit your business;</li>
<li>And more.</li>
</ul>
<p>And at the end, you will get a chance to try out one solution straight away.</p>
<p>So, if you want to get the best route optimization software for your business, this guide is for you.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-route-optimization-software">What is route optimization software?</h2>
<p><strong>Route optimization software</strong> is a tool for planning routes automatically. It helps you plan the best routes by mapping multiple delivery stops for all of your drivers or vehicles in all of your delivery fleets.</p>
<p>But it’s not just used for reaching point B from point A. Route optimization software lets you plan multiple routes that have multiple drop-off or pick-up destinations.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/dashboard.jpg" alt="Route optimization software multiple drop-offs" title="Multiple drop-off locations on route."></p>
<p>The tool is designed for <strong>managing field service</strong>, <strong>delivery</strong>, and <strong>logistics operations</strong>.</p>
<p>And managers and planners use it to improve the speed and efficiency of those services.</p>
<p>In short: Route optimization lets you create the most efficient routes in seconds for all of the locations your drivers need to reach.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-route-optimization-work">How does route optimization work?</h2>
<p>The best route optimization tools are mainly used to plan and map out routes to drop-off locations.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/route-optimization.jpg" alt="route optimization map" title="Map of route with tasks."></p>
<p>You can also use a route planner to create tasks (order deliveries). But keep in mind that there is a <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/difference-between-route-planning-and-route-optimization/" title="difference between route planning and route optimization"><strong>difference between route planning and route optimization</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/task-ordering-and-scheduling.jpg" alt="route optimization software task window" title="Task creation window."></p>
<p>You can do this either manually by uploading tasks one by one, in bulk via CSV files, or using an API to automatically connect it to an order management system.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/plug-in.png" alt="task import route optimization software" title="Importing tasks via route optimization software."></p>
<p>Modern routing tools let you create driver profiles. You can use these <a href="https://elogii.com/capabilities/driver-management" title="driver management"><strong>driver management</strong></a> capabilities to create routes that match task requirements based on the driver’s vehicle, skill, vicinity, or relationship with the customer.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/driver-profile-management.jpg" alt="driver profile route optimization software" title="Driver profiles."></p>
<p>When you’re done planning the routes (and schedules), drivers automatically receive them via the <a href="https://elogii.com/capabilities/driver-app" title="driver app"><strong>Driver App</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/delivery_app.png" alt="driver app route optimization software" title="The driver app with route view."></p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you can’t change them in real-time. A drag-and-drop option lets you arrange and rearrange tasks while the system automatically adjusts the routes for maximum efficiency.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/5ed78e466d19d408902474.gif" alt="vehicle management route optimization software" title="Vehicle tracking via route optimization software."></p>
<p>It lets you access detailed information about each route at any given time. That includes ETAs, service, and waiting time for each task, total route distance, time, and vehicle capacity usage.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/vehicle_management_caps.png" alt="task information route optimization software" title="Task information."></p>
<p>When it comes to your supply chain, you can use the software for <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-effectively-plan-your-deliveries-planning-at-a-depot-level-vs-centralized-multi-depot-planning/"><strong>single or multi-depot planning</strong></a>. So you can add as many sites as you want.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/multi-depot-operations.jpg" alt="multiple depot route optimization software" title="Managing multiple vehicles, fleets, and depots with route optimization software"></p>
<p>And you can do this for your entire fleet regardless of its size. The tool easily supports five or a hundred vehicles, as well as multiple fleets regardless of whether you have an <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/internal-vs-external-delivery-fleet-everything-you-need-to-know/"><strong>internal vs. external delivery fleet</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Once everything is in place the entire route planning process takes minutes to complete (depending on how many vehicles and tasks you have).</p>
<p>The system lets you store information about previous tasks, schedules, and routes. So, you can easily retrieve recurring routes.</p>
<p>Technically, you can also use it to track and monitor <a href="https://elogii.com/capabilities/live-operations" title="monitor deliveries in real-time"><strong>live operations</strong></a> in real-time.</p>
<p>But it also allows you to set fixed routes based on predetermined collections or delivery orders.</p>
<p>Over time, this feature-rich environment has outgrown its initial purpose. In most cases, today route optimization is just <strong>one suite in an end-to-end solution known as the delivery route optimization software</strong>.</p>
<p>Despite all of these capabilities, many organizations continue to rely on pen and paper to plan their delivery or service routes.</p>
<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-manual-route-planning">What’s wrong with manual route planning?</h2>
<p><a href="https://elogii.com/blog/are-you-still-planning-manually/"><strong>Are you still manually planning routes?</strong></a></p>
<p>If you are, there are a lot of areas you are losing valuable resources.</p>
<p>First, you are probably highly dependent on one person who has a working knowledge of geography where your distribution takes place.</p>
<p>If that person leaves, the entire operation can quickly fall apart. It’s even worse if it’s a team of people.</p>
<p>It’s also wasteful. There is a lot of untapped potential among your staff that can better serve another area of your organization, like <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-build-an-agile-delivery-operation/" title="building an agile delivery"><strong>building an agile delivery operation</strong></a>.</p>
<p>So instead of building a flexible operation, you end up relying on fixed routes.</p>
<p>That makes it difficult to assign the best drivers or vehicles to specific tasks (<a href="https://elogii.com/capabilities/vehicle-management" title="delivery vehicle management software"><strong>vehicle management</strong></a>), and you miss out on opportunities to optimize and scale.</p>
<p>That leaves you with no room for real-time planning, so you can’t speed up the process.</p>
<p>Seeing how <strong>same-day and next-day delivery matters so much to your customers</strong>, you lose a competitive advantage without faster operations.</p>
<p>Even if you have been planning routes manually for a long time (and it works), it’s what’s holding back your business.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-route-optimization-tools">What are the benefits of route optimization tools?</h2>
<p>Regardless of what route optimization software you choose, there are at least ten ways they can benefit your operations:</p>
<h3 id="1-it-helps-you-identify-the-most-cost-effective-routes">#1 It helps you identify the most cost-effective routes.</h3>
<p>This is the main feature of route planning software. It relies on advanced algorithms to analyze and determine the best routes based on your parameters.</p>
<h3 id="2-it-reduces-the-total-distance-for-each-route">#2 It reduces the total distance for each route.</h3>
<p>Routing software determines driving distance based on the availability of your drivers and vehicles, not to mention tasks and schedule constraints.</p>
<p>It analyzes available resources to create routes that reduce drive time, improve <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/7-key-metrics-in-delivery-logistics-to-measure-for-success/" title="key metrics in delivery logistics"><strong>key metrics in delivery logistics</strong></a>, and save money by reducing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuel costs</li>
<li>Time spent on the road</li>
<li>Vehicle wear-and-tear</li>
<li>Vehicle maintenance costs</li>
<li>Traffic exposure</li>
<li>Safety risks</li>
<li>Insurance and liability costs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-it-improves-responsiveness">#3 It improves responsiveness.</h3>
<p>Quick dispatching (for same-day or next-day delivery), impromptu orders, or longer service times require fast rescheduling.</p>
<p><strong>Route optimization tools let dispatchers create orders live, and easily assign them in real-time.</strong></p>
<h3 id="4-it-raises-customer-satisfaction">#4 It raises customer satisfaction.</h3>
<p>Convenience, speed, and reliability are key factors customers use to determine the quality of your delivery. But they also want a human touch.</p>
<p><strong>Creating driver profiles using delivery route management software lets you match the right driver with the right customer.</strong></p>
<p>The Driver app ensures the best on-time arrival rates by allowing drivers to communicate with customers directly.</p>
<p>Not to mention, it helps nurture customer relationships and loyalty which reduces service windows without affecting the quality of customer service.</p>
<h3 id="5-it-increases-the-number-of-tasks-you-can-complete-each-day">#5 It increases the number of tasks you can complete each day.</h3>
<p>Because the software lets you dispatch orders in real-time, <strong>drivers can complete more tasks during their runs</strong>.</p>
<p>It also maintains workforce happiness, since any additional drop-offs or last-minute changes have the least travel distance.</p>
<h3 id="6-it-maximizes-the-use-of-your-fleet-capacity">#6 It maximizes the use of your fleet capacity.</h3>
<p>A route optimization tool gives you <strong>greater insight into the capacity of each vehicle in your fleet</strong>.</p>
<p>This helps you maximize output per vehicle by reducing idle cargo space, as well as maintain operational effectiveness <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-improve-last-mile-delivery-when-demand-exceeds-your-capacity/" title="when demand exceeds your capacity"><strong>when demand for delivery exceeds your capacities</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 id="7-it-minimizes-delays-en-route">#7 It minimizes delays en route.</h3>
<p><strong>Reducing the number of minutes your drivers spend in traffic has a significant impact on the cost of your operations.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/11/4660/pdf"><strong>a recent survey</strong></a> found that productivity loss due to traffic congestion in 2018 was $87 billion.</p>
<p>Route optimization tools let planners adjust routes based on incoming information from the field, which cuts costs and saves time spent on the road.</p>
<h3 id="8-it-boosts-the-happiness-of-your-workforce">#8 It boosts the happiness of your workforce.</h3>
<p>Planning routes automatically <strong>removes a lot of the pressure from your teams</strong>.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this benefits the dispatcher.</p>
<p>As they spend less time planning routes, they can dedicate themselves to driving better results elsewhere.</p>
<p>On the other, drivers feel less frustrated.</p>
<p>Planners can easily create multi-drop routes for drivers based on their preferences, or round trips with tight drop-offs and suitable break times.</p>
<p>And since the software automatically tracks progress and updates it across <strong>the delivery management platform</strong>, there is less unnecessary communication between teams.</p>
<h3 id="9-it-lets-you-optimize-your-fleet">#9 It lets you optimize your fleet.</h3>
<p><strong>Optimizing routes helps you discover waste in your operations.</strong></p>
<p>It lets you reassess the size of your fleet with greater precision, so you can right-size the number of vehicles.</p>
<p>And fewer vans or trucks mean <strong>fewer field operators</strong>, <strong>less fuel</strong>, <strong>less equipment</strong>, and <strong>less maintenance</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="10-it-raises-the-output-and-performance-quality-of-your-team">#10 It raises the output and performance quality of your team.</h3>
<p>Tracking and tracing the progress of the workforce lets you <strong>assess their output</strong>.</p>
<p>This can help you identify inefficiencies in the process, as well as your workforce, and optimize before it hinders your operations.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-route-optimization-cost">How much does route optimization cost?</h2>
<p>The average starting cost of route optimization software is around $20 per vehicle. But this price depends on a few factors.</p>
<p>First, it depends on whether you just want route optimization, or do you want to invest in a more robust system and choose <strong>delivery management software</strong>.</p>
<p>Then it depends on whether you want to choose an on-premise solution or <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/adopting-the-cloud-first-approach-to-delivery-logistics/"><strong>adopt a cloud-first approach to managing delivery logistics</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>On-premise solutions typically cost more and require an upfront payment.</strong></p>
<p>You pay for a perpetual license or sanctioned copy of the software, but not the necessary infrastructure that supports it.</p>
<p>Companies like <strong>Paragon</strong>, <strong>Descartes</strong>, and <strong>Trimble TMW</strong> offer these solutions.</p>
<p><strong>SaaS solutions are less expensive.</strong></p>
<p>Instead of buying to own the software, you (usually) pay an annual monthly fee to use it.</p>
<p>But the provider supplies the supporting infrastructure, so there are no additional costs.</p>
<p>It’s an operating expense rather than a capital expense (<strong>Opex vs. Capex</strong>).</p>
<p>The cost also depends on the size of your fleet.</p>
<p>Some SaaS companies set the price <strong>per vehicle per month</strong>.</p>
<p>Companies like <strong>Maxoptra</strong>, <strong>Routific</strong>, and <strong>Optimoroute</strong> use this method.</p>
<p>And it depends on the features you want and the complexity of your operations.</p>
<p>Companies like <strong>eLogii</strong>, <strong>Onfleet</strong>, and <strong>Tookan</strong> use this payment model.</p>
<p>Today, most companies choose SaaS over on-premise legacy solutions. And tend to pay for features rather than the number of vehicles they operate.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="is-route-optimization-better-than-delivery-management-software">Is route optimization better than delivery management software?</h2>
<p>Yes, but only if you need additional features and capabilities to manage your operations.</p>
<p>Using just route optimization software works best for small businesses.</p>
<p>Those companies that neither have a big fleet nor require additional capabilities, such as <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/reverse-logistics-how-to-turn-failure-into-opportunity/"><strong>reverse logistics</strong></a>.</p>
<p>However, this doesn’t mean you won’t scale your operations at some point.</p>
<p>And delivery management software has the upper hand here.</p>
<p>Whether you want to achieve <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-achieve-uninterrupted-pharmacy-delivery-in-2020/" title="pharmacy delivery software"><strong>an uninterrupted pharmacy delivery</strong></a>, a way to manage field service operations, or a better way to optimize <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/the-role-delivery-management-software-plays-for-restaurants-and-dark-kitchens/" title="restaurant delivery management software"><strong>food delivery in your restaurant</strong></a>, it has you covered.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what other companies can use the platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://elogii.com/industries/3pl-couriers" title="delivery management software for 3PL"><strong>Third-party logistics (3PL)</strong></a></li>

<li><a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-optimize-beverage-delivery-in-2020/" title="beverage delivery"><strong>Beverage distributors</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://elogii.com/blog/9-biggest-delivery-challenges-for-ecommerce-and-how-to-solve-them/" title="delivery challenges for ecommerce"><strong>eCommerce</strong></a> and <a href="https://elogii.com/industries/non-food-retail" title="eCommerce and retail delivery management software"><strong>retailers</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://elogii.com/industries/pharmaceutical-healthcare" title="Delivery management software for healthcare"><strong>Healthcare</strong></a></li>

<li><a href="https://elogii.com/industries/restaurants-dark-kitchens" title="food delivery management software"><strong>Dark kitchens and food delivery</strong></a></li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>Strictly speaking, it’s an end-to-end solution that is well-suited to any task or industry or size of the organization.</p>
<p>Plus, that makes it more cost-effective once you grow.</p>
