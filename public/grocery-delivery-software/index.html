          <p>This is the definitive and complete guide to grocery delivery software.</p>
<p>If you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know what is grocery delivery management software</li>
<li>Explore all of the ways you can use the software to your advantage</li>
<li>See what it can do for your grocery delivery and how it does it</li>
<li>Learn how to choose the BEST software for your business</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you’ll appreciate this detailed guide and all that we’ve prepared for you.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="grocery-delivery-software-101">Grocery Delivery Software 101</h2>
<p>In this part of the post, we’re going to introduce you to the basics of grocery delivery software.</p>
<p>You’ll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>What it is and how it works;</li>
<li>What makes it different;</li>
<li>Why do you need it;</li>
</ul>
<p>And how grocery delivery software can help you overcome the challenges brought up by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-grocery-delivery-software">What is grocery delivery software?</h3>
<p><strong>Grocery delivery software</strong> is a logistical tool designed to help you automatically manage delivery activities, such as scheduling pick-ups and drop-offs, planning routes, dispatching drivers, and tracking progress across operations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called grocery delivery software because it lets you handle all tasks from when you receive an order to when you deliver it to the customer.</p>
<p>That includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating tasks and schedules;</li>
<li>Planning and optimizing routes;</li>
<li>Assigning orders to drivers;</li>
<li>Dispatching drivers;</li>
<li>Tracking progress;</li>
<li>Notifying customers;</li>
<li>Collecting feedback;</li>
<li>And more.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-grocery-delivery-software-work">How does grocery delivery software work?</h3>
<p>Grocery delivery software is a complex system.</p>
<p>It has multiple modules for handling different desired actions.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/rsz_platform_diagram.png" alt="delivery-management-platform" title="delivery management platform"></p>
<p>For example, one module is responsible for planning routes, while another for tracking your driver on those routes.</p>
<p>Each module relies on its own set of codes and algorithms to perform these operations.</p>
<p>And all of them integrate to a centralized system - <strong>the grocery delivery platform</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read this post to know whether <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/to-centralize-or-not-to-centralize-delivery/" title="to centralize or not to centralize delivery operations"><strong>to centralize or not to centralize delivery operations.</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see (and use) the platform via its two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dashboard</li>
<li>The driver app</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The dashboard</strong> is the central control panel. From there, you have full use of all of the modules and a real-time view of the operation.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/route-optimization-software.png" alt="route-optimization-software" title="route optimization software"><br>
For example, you can assign tasks to drivers. Or dispatch drivers to a customer location. Or see where your drivers are on the map.</p>
<p><strong>The driver app</strong> is a mobile version (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elogii.delivery.mobile&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US" title="driver app for android"><strong>Android</strong></a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elogii-driver/id1481789574" title="driver app for ios"><strong>iOS</strong></a>) of the software. It gives access to vital data and functions to drivers which they need to perform tasks in the field.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/delivery_app.png" alt="driver-app" title="driver app"></p>
<p>For example, a driver can see where his future drop-offs are going to be. Or view the name of his next customer. Or collect the <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/electronic-proof-of-delivery-epod-how-does-it-improve-logistics-operations/" title="electronic proof of delivery"><strong>electronic proof of delivery</strong></a>.</p>
<p>So with grocery delivery software, there’s ONE tool for managing the entire delivery.</p>
<p>And that’s what makes it unique.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-grocery-delivery-software-different-from-other-solutions">How is grocery delivery software different from other solutions?</h3>
<p>Grocery delivery software is an end-to-end solution.</p>
<p>It can connect to other vital tools that you use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online grocery store;</li>
<li>Order management system;</li>
<li>Inventory managing software;</li>
<li>And others.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is possible, thanks to API integration. (But more on that later)</p>
<p>So like we’ve just mentioned, all you need is one tool to manage the entire supply chain.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-grocery-delivery-software-work-so-well-for-business">Why does grocery delivery software work so well for business?</h3>
<p>Unlike legacy systems, grocery delivery software works on the cloud.</p>
<p>Besides the many benefits of this, <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/adopting-the-cloud-first-approach-to-delivery-logistics/" title="adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics"><strong>adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics</strong></a> enables you to:</p>

<li>Gain real-time visibility;</li>
<li>Build an agile delivery;</li>
<li>Take a holistic approach to logistics, and;</li>
<li>Scale as you grow.</li>

<p>It&rsquo;s easier to stay on top of what&rsquo;s going on, regardless of size, scale, and order volumes.</p>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<p>Who can use grocery delivery software?</p>
<p>In the second part of the article, we’ll turn our attention to you - the user.</p>
<p>Here, you’ll find out whether grocery delivery software is the right tool for your business.</p>
<p>Specifically, you’ll see whether the system can match your needs. And the nature of your grocery delivery.</p>
<p>Let’s jump right in.</p>
<h3 id="for-online-grocery-shopping">For online grocery shopping</h3>
<p><strong>Online grocery shopping</strong> isn’t a new invention.</p>
<p>But COVID-19 and social distancing have prompted more stores to rethink their approach and move their offer online.</p>
<p>If you own an online grocery store, then you rely a lot on delivery.</p>
<p>But you also know that it’s not your main sales offer. (Groceries are)</p>
<p>So, you need to keep delivery costs down. But also provide the best service to customers.</p>
<p>(More on the benefits of grocery delivery software later)</p>
<h3 id="for-a-standalone-single-grocery-store">For a standalone (single) grocery store</h3>
<p>If you have <strong>a single bricks and mortar grocery store</strong>, you might overlook the benefits of the software.</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is that technology can help you.</p>
<p>You know that a lot of your regulars are buying more and more groceries from places like Amazon’s Whole Foods, Tesco, ASDA, Walmart, Sainsbury’s, and other chains.</p>
<p>And you know <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/the-state-of-delivery-in-time-of-the-coronavirus/" title="the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus"><strong>the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus</strong></a> has reshaped the landscape.</p>
<p>In 2020, many customers have shopped online using Uber, Doordash, Postmates, Grubhub, and Glovo grocery delivery.</p>
<p>And it may seem like dire straits there is a solution:</p>
<p>The secret to know <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-compete-with-amazon-delivery/" title="how to compete with Amazon delivery"><strong>how to compete with Amazon delivery</strong></a>, Walmart, GrubHub and other giants, is to co-exist with them.</p>
<p>But that means you’ll need to <strong>evaluate your strengths and weaknesses and rethink the way you deliver groceries.</strong></p>
<p>Based on experience, we suggest that you focus on <strong>the local last-mile</strong>.</p>
<p>Cover the local delivery area (3-5 kilometres) near your store. But use delivery management software to increase the speed and efficiency of your operations.</p>
<h3 id="for-grocery-chains">For grocery chains</h3>
<p>Like mom-and-pop stores, it isn’t easy <strong>grocery chains</strong>, either.</p>
<p>For you, grocery delivery software isn’t a huge investment. But it still helps you raise the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of your delivery.</p>
<p>Specifically, the software is a one-stop solution.</p>
<p>So, all you need is <strong>one tool to manage delivery at each one of your stores</strong>.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it&rsquo;s a regional or nationwide chain of stores, you have complete control and visibility from one central location.</p>
<h3 id="grocery-delivery-software-for-different-types-of-delivery">Grocery delivery software for different types of delivery</h3>
<p>Grocery delivery software isn’t limited just to the kind of store you have. You can also use it for different purposes.</p>
<p>Including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grocery home delivery</strong></li>
<li><strong>Grocery curbside delivery</strong></li>
<li><strong>Doorstep grocery delivery</strong></li>
<li><strong>On-demand grocery delivery</strong></li>
<li><strong>Grocery in-store pickup</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s because grocery delivery software is an end-to-end solution.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on one area of operations, it enables you to take a holistic approach.</p>
<p>You can <strong>manage the entire life-cycle of each delivery</strong>. (From the moment you receive an order to when a driver drops it off to the customer)</p>
<p>At the same time, you can <strong>monitor every aspect of last-mile delivery</strong>. (From how you source supplies to how much inventory you have to where your drivers are in the field)</p>
<p>Which means <strong>you can communicate internally and externally</strong>, such as customers and suppliers, as well as different teams inside your organization.</p>
<p>And that’s the main reason why grocery delivery software supports any offer you provide to customers.</p>
<h2 id="heading-1"></h2>
<p>How to use grocery delivery software to improve last-mile delivery?</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to show you exactly how to improve your grocery delivery.</p>
<p>Specifically, you’ll see the top three last-mile challenges and how software helps you to overcome them.</p>
<p>You’ll learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow the rate of delivery</li>
<li>Increase route density</li>
<li>Upgrade operations</li>
<li>Improve customer experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="last-mile-delivery-challenges-for-grocery-delivery">Last-mile delivery challenges for grocery delivery</h3>
<p>The last mile is a logistical problem because it requires you to manage customer expectations efficiently.</p>
<p>Which means you will have to make it super easy for customers to order and receive groceries.</p>
<p>And this can be difficult to achieve when you don&rsquo;t want to waste a lot of resources.</p>
<p>Which means you will have to optimize the last mile.</p>
<p>When it comes to grocery delivery, we believe that these three challenges will be your leading concerns:</p>
<h4 id="completing-multiple-delivery-stops">Completing multiple delivery stops</h4>
<p>Last-mile delivery isn’t about travelling from point A to point B, and back.</p>
<p>First, that kind of delivery raises the number of miles drivers have to travel. Which means you increase <strong>the cost per delivery</strong>.</p>
<p>Second, you need a big fleet if drivers have to return to the store after each delivery. So, you can’t handle <strong>large order volumes</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s not very cost-effective.</p>
<p>So, drivers need to have more than one stop (drop-off) on their routes. (Even when delivering perishable groceries)</p>
<p>But each drop-off adds to the time it takes to complete each route.</p>
<p>Just one stop involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travelling to the destination</li>
<li>Waiting in traffic</li>
<li>Finding the right address</li>
<li>Walking to the door</li>
<li>Interacting with the customer</li>
<li>Walking back to the vehicle</li>
</ul>
<p>And that can take 30 minutes or more depending on the delivery area your store covers.</p>
<p>So, there is still a lot of wasted resources in this process, as well.</p>
<h4 id="delivering-groceries-in-dense-neighbourhoods">Delivering groceries in dense neighbourhoods</h4>
<p>It’s one thing to deliver 15 tons of groceries from a supplier to your warehouse using a truck on a motorway.</p>
<p>It’s quite another for a van to deliver that same amount to homes and offices in a dense urban area.</p>
<p>Drivers have to deal with speed limits, narrow and one-way streets, traffic congestion, public transportation, and pedestrians. And to and from multiple stops, several times a day.</p>
<p>All of that lowers <strong>the speed of delivery</strong>.</p>
<p>Which means delivering groceries in cities and to rural areas takes a lot more time.</p>
<h4 id="handling-missed-and-failed-deliveries">Handling missed and failed deliveries</h4>
<p><strong>Order accuracy</strong> is a common problem with direct-to-consumer delivery.</p>
<p>But accuracy can drop for many reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The customer gave you the wrong address;</li>
<li>The customer isn’t at home;</li>
<li>The driver failed to find the address;</li>
<li>The order got misplaced during packaging;</li>
<li>And others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some might be the fault of your workforce. Some are the fault of your customers. But all of them hurt your business.</p>
<p>For starters, failed and missed deliveries damage your reputation. You risk losing customers over a bad experience and negative reviews.</p>
<p>At the same time, you need to cover the cost of reverse logistics, returns, and refunds. And that affects your bottom line.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="how-to-solve-last-mile-grocery-delivery-challenges">How to solve last-mile grocery delivery challenges?</h3>
<p>Those are the most common challenges of the last-mile. Now, let’s see how grocery delivery software helps you solve them:</p>
<h4 id="route-optimization">Route optimization</h4>
<p><strong>Route optimization is one of the main features of grocery delivery software.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/route-optimization.jpg" alt="route-optimization-software" title="route optimization software"><br>
Besides helping you find the best path from point A to point B, it also allows you to map multiple stops on multiple routes and for all of your drivers, automatically.</p>
<p>That takes away a lot of the pressure from route planners (especially if they <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/are-you-still-planning-manually/" title="are you still manually planning routes"><strong>are still manually planning</strong></a> routes).</p>
<p>Grocery delivery software works on the cloud.</p>
<p>All of the maps that you view on the dashboard are accurate and up to date. So, there is less chance for drivers to miss their drop-offs.</p>
<p>Likewise, using software to optimize routes lets you include a lot of parameters that reduce the time per delivery.</p>
<p>You can add:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Traffic patterns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stops and traffic lights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-side turns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access and exit points</p>
<p>(to pick-up and drop-off)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this cuts the time it takes to complete multi-stop delivery in dense urban areas.</p>
<h4 id="delivery-schedules">Delivery schedules</h4>
<p><strong>Grocery delivery software allows you to manage schedules based on order volumes and daily tasks and activities.</strong></p>
<p>You can determine the actual time it takes a driver to complete a drop-off. But also, calculate the average time in transit more easily.</p>
<p>That enables you to create a schedule that maximizes drivers' productivity.</p>
<p>For example, you can set the time at each drop-off to 15 minutes. That leaves drivers enough time to find, walk up to, talk to the customer, and get back to their vehicles.</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>the software automatically calculates ETAs</strong>.</p>
<p>So, you know the travel time from one location to the next. Which means you can track idle time.</p>
<p>After you add lunch breaks, rests, refuelling/resupply stops, you know the exact number of deliveries each driver can handle during a shift.</p>
<p>Planning schedules like this raise the route density for each driver. Which means you lower the cost per delivery, as well.</p>
<p>But you also increase the speed of delivery. That grows the rate of fulfilment, so you can easily handle multi-stop routes in dense urban areas.</p>
<p>Plus, you gain complete control over the whole schedule.</p>
<p>Which means you can add contingency time in case you come across missed or failed deliveries.</p>

<h4 id="driver-and-fleet-management">Driver and fleet management</h4>
<p>If you have a chain of stores, different fleets likely cover different delivery areas.</p>
<p>Grocery delivery software helps you with this, as well.</p>
<p><strong>You can input information about each driver and vehicle in every fleet into the system.</strong></p>
<p>For example, a unique skill, or specialized equipment, or various load capacities.</p>
<p>That allows you to rightsize each fleet based on the demand within its area of operation.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-improve-last-mile-delivery-when-demand-exceeds-your-capacity/" title="when demand exceeds your capacity"><strong>when demand exceeds your capacity</strong></a>, your last-mile won’t suffer.</p>
<h4 id="live-control--visibility">Live control &amp; visibility</h4>
<p><strong>On-demand grocery delivery has to rely on speed.</strong> (Especially since the outbreak of COVID-19)</p>
<p>Traditionally, when a new order arrives, you would deliver it tomorrow. Or, the customer would have to order groceries ahead of time.</p>
<p>That’s not very convenient.</p>
<p><strong>That’s why all of the mentioned features work in real-time, as well.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And since you have a complete overview of what’s happening on the map, you control the whole delivery on the go.</strong></p>
<p>For example, grocery delivery apps allow you to offer <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/same-day-delivery-and-delivery-management-software/" title="same-day delivery and delivery management software"><strong>same-day delivery</strong></a>.</p>
<p>When an order arrives, you can see which driver is closest to the nearest store, or warehouse, and add a new pick-up and drop-off to his route.</p>
<p>The driver gets notified about the new tasks via the driver app, while the customer receives the order faster than expected.</p>
<p><strong>Real-time capabilities are also useful when you have to handle failed or missed deliveries.</strong></p>
<p>If a driver notifies you about a return, you can assign an available driver to pick-up and deliver the order straight away.</p>
<p>And in the case of a missed delivery, you can have two drivers meet, exchange orders, and drop them off at a more convenient time for the customer.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the fault of someone on your team or the customer, you won&rsquo;t risk the reputation of your business.</p>
<p>You can handle <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/reverse-logistics-how-to-turn-failure-into-opportunity/" title="reverse logistics"><strong>reverse logistics</strong></a> fast. And without consequence to customer experience.</p>
<p>But this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>There are a lot more ways grocery delivery software improves your service.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-grocery-delivery-software">Benefits of grocery delivery software</h2>
<p>This part of the article is a list of some of the best benefits of grocery delivery software.</p>
<p>We’ll not only provide you with a bunch of advantages of the software but why each one can work for your grocery delivery. (Regardless of its size and shape)</p>
<p>More importantly, we’ll show you how you and your customers can get MORE value.</p>
<p>Let’s check out these benefits.</p>
<h3 id="convenient-grocery-delivery-experience">Convenient grocery delivery experience</h3>
<p>We’ve touched on convenience a bit. But did you know that it’s one of the top three reasons why your customers shop online?</p>
<p>In a study on <a href="https://www.pwc.com/future-of-cx"><strong><em>The Future of Customer Experience</em> by PwC</strong></a>, <strong>80% of customers</strong> said that <strong>speed, convenience and knowledgeable service</strong> are what they value most.</p>
<p>In the same way that it’s more convenient for customers to order online, it should be just as easy to receive them.</p>
<p>Enter: <strong>grocery delivery management software</strong>.</p>
<p>First, the software lets you offer customers to choose when they want orders to arrive.</p>
<p>You can set up specific time windows customers can choose at checkout.</p>
<p>You can let them choose the date of delivery but also the time of day when they want it to arrive, like mornings or afternoons.</p>
<p>That means customers can organize themselves around work and other activities, rather than the ETA of their order.</p>
<p>For your business, that means greater accuracy. And you reduce the chance of missed deliveries.</p>
<p>Using a grocery delivery platform also allows you to send tracking links and notifications.</p>
<p>Customers can remain involved in the delivery process by tracking their order on the map.</p>
<p>So, they know exactly where their order is, and when the driver will drop it off.</p>
<p>And for the very best doorstep grocery delivery experience, drivers can send quick reminders. Or you can set up automatic notifications.</p>
<p>So once a driver confirms that the delivery is complete, the app automatically sends a text message or email to the next customer that their order is on its way.</p>
<h3 id="complete-integration">Complete integration</h3>
<p><strong>None of the above would be possible without complete integration.</strong></p>
<p>In truth, working with a host of separate apps isn’t that different from manual planning using pen and paper.</p>
<p>You may use an order management system for your online grocery store, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retail management systems;</li>
<li>Retail POS (point of sale) software;</li>
<li>Online grocery ordering stores and marketplaces;</li>
<li>Online ordering apps;</li>
<li>White-labelled grocery apps;</li>
<li>And others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or you can connect it with an inventory management solution to track and order supplies.</p>
<p>And any other tools you use for the supply chain, warehouse, or customer support.</p>
<p>All of these systems can integrate with grocery delivery software.</p>
<p>That means you can take a holistic approach to your delivery. And manage everything from one central platform.</p>
<h3 id="coordinated-pick-up--drop-off">Coordinated pick-up &amp; drop-off</h3>
<p><strong>Thanks to real-time control and visibility, as well as complete integration, you can coordinate the pick-up and drop-off of each delivery.</strong></p>
<p>That’s why you can use grocery delivery software regardless of whether you use an <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/internal-vs-external-delivery-fleet-everything-you-need-to-know/" title="internal vs external delivery fleet"><strong>internal vs external delivery fleet</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Let’s say you use a 3PL provider.</p>
<p>For example, you can integrate it with their tracking software to monitor the dedicated fleet as they deliver groceries to your customers.</p>
<p>And you can just as well use it to coordinate pick-up with your suppliers. Or organize the in-store pick-up for click &amp; collect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can orchestrate internal teams, as well.</p>
<p>For example, you can use the grocery delivery system to schedule pick-ups at depot locations.</p>
<p>Inventory managers can plan pick-up times based on the drivers’ delivery schedules.</p>
<p>That can prevent any overlaps at the depot site, which might create bottlenecks and slow down fulfilment.</p>
<p>And it works regardless of whether you <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/planning-at-depot-level-vs-multi-depot-planning/" title="plan at a depot level vs multi-depot planning"><strong>plan at a depot level vs multi-depot planning</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Plus, you can do this for all of your teams, from route planners, to dispatch and customer support.</p>
<h3 id="flexible--faster-grocery-delivery">Flexible &amp; faster grocery delivery</h3>
<p><strong>Aligning internal teams and integrating with different solutions makes your grocery delivery faster and more flexible.</strong></p>
<p>Controlling tasks from a central platform means you manage every part of your organization.</p>
<p>That includes the <strong>structure</strong>, <strong>process</strong>, <strong>people</strong>, and <strong>technology</strong>.</p>
<p>And you can do all of that on the go.</p>
<p>This active approach means you can make swift assessments, quick decisions, and take rapid action in various situations.</p>
<p>At the same time, you have complete visibility over all of your resources.</p>
<p>That makes it easier to readjust operations and align with the needs and requirements of your plan of action.</p>
<p>Not only does this make your delivery faster and more flexible. But it’s also the first step to build an agile delivery operation.</p>
<h3 id="efficient-grocery-delivery">Efficient grocery delivery</h3>
<p>Grocery delivery software impacts all areas of your operations.</p>
<p>That improves <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/7-key-metrics-in-delivery-logistics-to-measure-for-success/" title="key metrics in delivery logistics"><strong>key metrics in delivery logistics</strong></a>. And that&rsquo;s what makes your delivery more efficient.</p>
<p>For example, when you raise <strong>on-time delivery</strong> and <strong>order accuracy</strong>, you boost customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>So more people feel driven to buy more groceries from you. (Rather than from rival stores)</p>
<p>At the same time, optimizing routes to cut <strong>the average time per delivery</strong> speeds up fulfilment.</p>
<p>Which means you can handle more deliveries. (Without investing extra resources)</p>
<p>Greater efficiency helps you achieve three things:</p>
<p><strong>First, you improve performance</strong></p>
<p>Better performance raises productivity and the amount of profit you can generate.</p>
<p><strong>Then, you optimize operations</strong></p>
<p>That helps you maximize cost-effectiveness by reducing waste in your process. So you can make better use of what you have (your resources).</p>
<p><strong>And finally, you become more sustainable.</strong></p>
<p>From vehicle wear and tear to employee happiness, you protect your assets while conserving time, money, and energy.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-choose-a-grocery-delivery-software">How to choose a grocery delivery software?</h2>
<p>At this point in the article, you know pretty much everything there is to know about grocery delivery software.</p>
<p>And you probably want one for your store.</p>
<p>Great!</p>
<p>Now it’s time to check out the advanced characteristics that can help you make a better decision and choose the BEST solution.</p>
<p>Let’s start.</p>
<h3 id="online-grocery-delivery-software">Online grocery delivery software</h3>
<p>If we could give you one piece of advice to choose the best solution for your business, it’s this:</p>
<p><strong>Choose grocery delivery software that you can access online. That it’s a web-based solution.</strong></p>
<p>What this means is that you can access the software from anywhere, using a web browser like Google Chrome, Safari, Opera, or Firefox.</p>
<p>Of course, these days, a lot of grocery delivery apps are web-based. But it’s still just as important, and for several reasons:</p>
<p>First, <strong>delivery management software</strong> that’s web-based is much more affordable.</p>
<p>Instead of buying a 10-times more expensive copy or license, you subscribe to use the software for a fixed period.</p>
<p>Usually, this means a monthly or yearly subscription. So, you can terminate as soon as your contract expires.</p>
<p><strong>Next, all web-based solutions operate on the public cloud.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/public-cloud-computing"><strong>Cloud computing</strong></a> means that you won’t have to invest extra money into extra technology, systems integration, or software updates.</p>
<p>All of that is automatically rolled-out by your SaaS provider.</p>
<p>And because it works on the cloud you can also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily collect, store, access, or recover data;</li>
<li>Use the software from unlimited locations;</li>
<li>Raise collaboration, mobility, and sustainability;</li>
<li>Increase security and prevent the loss of data;</li>
<li>Integrate with other systems and solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>And integration is the next property you should look for:</p>
<h3 id="api-integration">API Integration</h3>
<p>We’ve touched on the integration of grocery delivery software quite a bit. But what does that look like exactly?</p>
<p>Specifically, delivery management software has to have <strong>API integration</strong>.</p>
<p>API stands for application programming interface. Experts define it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>API integration is a connection between two or more applications, via their APIs, that lets those systems exchange data between each other.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://apifriends.com/api-management/whats-api-integration/"><strong>apifriends.com</strong></a></p>
<p>Without APIs, grocery delivery software would be just another stand-alone app.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to check if the solution has API integration capabilities. But also whether it can integrate with both internal and external systems.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should check out how data will move between systems. And how secure is that movement of data.</p>
<p>If you plan to share APIs with customers and partners, there has to be a secure port and a system of verification, as well.</p>
<h3 id="quick-import--export-of-data">Quick import &amp; export of data</h3>
<p><strong>Grocery delivery software should be able to handle multiple order requests at the same time.</strong></p>
<p>It should also import and export delivery data automatically. Which means the software transfers the order requests into tasks by itself.</p>
<p>When choosing a solution, make sure that the system allows you to upload files one by one and in bulk. And that it supports universal file formats (.xls, .pdf, .csv).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that automatic import &amp; export of data shouldn’t prevent you from doing it by hand. (Since you should always have a back-up plan)</p>
<h3 id="automated-reporting">Automated reporting</h3>
<p>Are you still manually planning?</p>
<p>Then you know, how difficult it is for all your teams to submit reports, proofs of delivery, and order receipts.</p>
<p>Then there is the way-too-long paper trail and all those cabinets that store those files.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that you have a customer complaint. And you need to access a file, quickly.</p>
<p>It won’t be easy. (Even if you have a spreadsheet to help you)</p>
<p><strong>It’s safe to assume that you need grocery delivery software with automated reporting.</strong></p>
<p>Delivery management software does this using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic proof of delivery (ePOD);</li>
<li>Historical data tracing, and;</li>
<li>Automated notifications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ePOD</strong> means that you can collect and store all your order requests, delivery confirmations, and shipping dockets within the system. (Both via the dashboard and driver app)</p>
<p><strong>Historical data tracing</strong>, on the other hand, will allow you to access that data.</p>
<p>You can use it to evaluate your operations. Not to mention, expand your database to improve the accuracy of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, you should check whether the software lets you set up automatic confirmations, alerts, and notifications.</strong></p>
<p>That is crucial when you want to minimize internal communication, but also improve customer experience.</p>
<p>Make sure the system supports in-app notifications, QR codes, email and SMS alerts.</p>
<h3 id="price">Price</h3>
<p>Of course, price is a top factor when choosing delivery software for your grocery store.</p>
<p>And it’s safe to assume that you want to spend the least amount of money for the highest gains and best features.</p>
<p>So, we did the math and compared prices.</p>
<p>On average, delivery management software costs <strong>$182.35</strong>, or <strong>£137.74</strong>.</p>
<p>But there is a lot that goes into the price. And a lot of providers that offer different solutions.</p>
<p>That’s why we did a deep dive into all of that.</p>
<p>So, you know the answer to the question: How much does <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-management-software-cost/" title="delivery management software cost"><strong>delivery management software cost</strong></a>?</p>
<p>(And how much you’ll end up paying once you’ve made your choice)</p>
