<p>Letâ€™s dive right into it.</p>
<h2 id="general-delivery-statistics">General Delivery Statistics</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/737418/parcel-traffic-worldwide-by-sector/"><strong>15.05 billion deliveries</strong></a> are completed worldwide in 2020.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/376/100/platform-to-consumer-delivery/worldwide"><strong>704.7 million people</strong></a> will use platform-to-consumer delivery in 2020.</li>
<li>The average cost of delivery is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/781089/parcel-delivery-costs-urban-commercial-transport/"><strong>$6.4 per cubic meter</strong></a>.</li>
<li>The average time per delivery is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/781194/day-night-parcel-delivery-time-urban-commercial-transport/"><strong>12 minutes</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Standard delivery takes approximately <a href="https://www.parcelmonkey.com/delivery-services/standard-shipping?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=df67db4aa172c01790221b0ea178619c5bea6284-1597220236-0-AWHh6ADVl5boHZWTw9roS02qq0mIzcQBS0-i6Sen0nymBZbtSVLGqdYVlIHh61NijLwGXoy8Vzyhh5lfB4dP7AIpsY0gB5DZuLNWQETLbhcvrD6kMnT93EImfozVFbq9pmMa-4GwDzOTPUQWdRdrK0UgN1ppDmCiZNe0m1wQ28QLmt-_TIJrN6iK2ooMGUWdei1FwTOdL5Jfy2TtjzcEyLUnjln1yMcGOx7bZVvy4dVULxH0jUMCRVVVhOu9yDCJqkDNJE9TJtfu3AJ-qL0CtbVbMFYSqc1NQlZFauO8tK9KypUGmSm2Dto3qyRX5lX7p4CkyzCh43aaQGPjkTthzaI8F-KfUGcmDGxOs3_7E8bjxNsbMh1alcbopTwGfIcZBSG0WwUXta5ppefbrpLUhoT69jdSyYs3IxS-v2SxkaKUridILo9C4_akMSh7uueVDKijydCHrWut6syFCvImNiWjbTjlaiwyxEpWXJ2iDZm_OT_rQoPWD_nKZa9oym15gamJyGwSjitdWEVMr2jDcVtKSR1XZiL-uufL7J4rxfgjVL8tcLyC9Xn1ejbAcyNbUhY4WZkRDG3_1EalQ0_uCRjvMTlsHKYEB_FmIy_Mt_YQ"><strong>3-5 business days</strong></a> to be completed.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/722366/package-delivery-methods-among-millennials-worldwide/"><strong>66% of customers</strong></a> prefer home-delivery to any other type of delivery service.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-transport-infrastructure/our-insights/how-customer-demands-are-reshaping-last-mile-delivery"><strong>70% of those customers</strong></a> are content with the cheapest form of home delivery option, while 23% of them would pay a premium price for same-day delivery.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/720415/market-size-of-parcel-services-in-united-states-by-product-type/"><strong>55% of shoppers</strong></a> in the US prefer same-day delivery to any other time of arrival.</li>
<li>Thatâ€™s because <a href="https://www.usfoods.com/our-services/business-trends/2019-food-delivery-statistics.html"><strong>58% of consumers</strong></a> donâ€™t want to wait more than 40 minutes for their deliveries to arrive.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/1.jpg" alt="How long will people wait for delivery" title="How long will people wait for delivery"></p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Itâ€™s also why <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/720415/market-size-of-parcel-services-in-united-states-by-product-type/"><strong>30% of the total market share of priority same-day delivery</strong></a> belongs to the United States.</li>
<li>But, in general, nearly half, or <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/561768/fast-online-order-delivery-us-consumers/"><strong>44% of customers</strong></a> donâ€™t mind waiting two days for their delivery to arrive.</li>
<li>The reason is free shipping. <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/10/delivery-statistics.html#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%2095%25%20of%20consumers,comes%20to%20meeting%20consumers'%20expectations."><strong>95% of consumers prefer free-one-day delivery</strong></a> as their ideal delivery method.</li>
<li>And <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/482963/free-shipping-measures-of-us-shoppers/"><strong>48% of customers</strong></a> will add more items to their shopping cart if it means they qualify for free shipping.</li>
<li>Companies that add a free shipping threshold can <a href="https://www.reddoor.biz/blog/case-study-rdi-a-b-testing-finds-that-adding-free/"><strong>increase orders by 90%</strong></a>.</li>
<li>This will see the last mile delivery market grow to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1103574/autonomous-last-mile-delivery-market-size-worldwide/"><strong>$91.5 billion by 2030</strong></a>. A $79.5 billion rise compared to the value in 2019.</li>
<li>And if forecasts for 2030 are right, there will also be a <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_the_last_mile_ecosystem.pdf"><strong>78% increase in last-mile deliveries</strong></a> in urban areas across the world.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ecommerce-and-delivery">eCommerce and Delivery</h2>
<ol start="17">
<li>eCommerce is driving delivery. Thatâ€™s why <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-ecommerce-2019"><strong>10% of all retail sales</strong></a> were completed online in 2019.</li>
<li>At least <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_the_last_mile_ecosystem.pdf"><strong>82% of all global consumers</strong></a> have shopped online in the previous three months.</li>
<li>Worldwide eCommerce retail sales will reach <a href="https://www.shopify.com/plus/guides/global-ecommerce?itcat=plusblog&amp;itterm=global-ecommerce-statistics"><strong>$4.9 trillion by 2021</strong></a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/e-commerce-sales-2014-2021-1.png" alt="ecommerce-sales-statistics" title="Ecommerce sales statistics worldwide"></p>
<ol start="20">
<li>When it comes to online shopping, <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/nielsenglobal/de/docs/connected-commerce-report.pdf"><strong>a survey by Nielsen</strong></a> suggests these are the most common items you will find at checkout:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/online-purchasing-by-product-category-1.png" alt="online-purchasing-statistics" title="Online purchasing statistics"></p>
<ol start="21">
<li>But online shoppers in the US are willing to pay <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/705977/maximum-amount-willing-to-pay-for-shipping-in-the-us/"><strong>up to $5 for shipping</strong></a>.</li>
<li>And this makes the last-mile worth <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-transport-infrastructure/our-insights/the-endgame-for-postal-networks-how-to-win-in-the-age-of-e-commerce"><strong>approximately $115 billion</strong></a> out of the $270 total revenue pool from eCommerce.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="amazon-delivery">Amazon Delivery</h2>
<ol start="23">
<li>Amazon is a key player in eCommerce. That&rsquo;s why <a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/industries/retail-and-e-commerce-113138"><strong>68% of all US consumers</strong></a> begin their search on Amazon.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s one of the reasons Amazon.com has been able to generate <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266282/annual-net-revenue-of-amazoncom/"><strong>$280.5 billion</strong></a> from eCommerce.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/technology/amazon-coronavirus-target-walmart.html"><strong>Amazon shares fell</strong></a> from 42% before the COVID-19 outbreak to 34% in April 2020.</li>
<li>But thatâ€™s not going to stop the company. Amazon has <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_the_last_mile_ecosystem.pdf"><strong>the largest delivery infrastructure in the world</strong></a> with 390 warehouses and over 20,000 delivery vehicles.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s one of the reasons why it costs <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/236503/amazons-annual-shipping-revenue-and-outbound-shipping-costs/"><strong>$16.2 billion</strong></a> to run Amazonâ€™s reverse logistics operations.</li>
<li>Still, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/05/amazon-can-already-ship-to-72percent-of-us-population-in-a-day-map-shows.html"><strong>72% of Amazon deliveries</strong></a> are fulfilled within 24 hours for all of their customers.</li>
<li>That, and the ability to offer free shipping is why <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/670499/us-amazon-usage-reason/"><strong>79.8% of shoppers</strong></a> in the US choose Amazon. Other key factors include a broad selection of offers (68.9%), Prime membership (65.7%), and best pricing (49.2%).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/statistic_id670499_key-factors-for-us-users-to-shop-via-amazon-2020.jpg" alt="why people shop at Amazon" title="why people shop at Amazon"></p>
<h2 id="delivery-statistics-by-industry">Delivery Statistics by Industry</h2>
<ol start="30">
<li>
<p>Key delivery statistics appear in every industry, including yours. For example, <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_the_last_mile_ecosystem.pdf"><strong>32% of the furniture</strong></a> in the US will be sold online and delivered to the customersâ€™ homes by 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When it comes to food delivery, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1120211/coronavirus-grocery-delivery-pickup-sales-us/"><strong>the sale of grocery delivery and pickup</strong></a> in the United States has grown by $6 billion from August 2019 to June 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of orders has also increased from August 2019 to June 2020 by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1120235/coronavirus-grocery-delivery-pickup-orders-us/"><strong>68.9 million orders</strong></a> thanks to COVID-19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By contrast, only <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/971676/online-alcohol-sales-growth-us/"><strong>1% of total alcohol sales</strong></a> in the US are completed online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1106497/likelihood-online-food-delivery-due-to-coronavirus-home-usa/"><strong>41.7% of US consumers</strong></a> likely to purchase food online due to the Coronavirus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104915/spending-on-grocery-delivery-coronavirus-us/"><strong>61% of consumers</strong></a> donâ€™t expect to spend more on grocery delivery due to the outbreak of COVID-19. But, 17% say they will buy more groceries online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonetheless, there are <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/100/online-food-delivery/worldwide"><strong>1,231.9 million</strong></a> food delivery users in the world in 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And in 2024, the number of platform-to-consumer delivery and restaurant-to-consumer delivery will be <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/376/100/platform-to-consumer-delivery/worldwide"><strong>965.8 million</strong></a> each.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/rsz_number_of_food_delivery_users.png" alt="number of delivery users" title="number of delivery users"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And with a <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/100/online-food-delivery/worldwide#market-globalRevenue"><strong>25% year-over-year growth</strong></a>, the food delivery industry will rise to $182 billion by 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But it isnâ€™t without its problems. In fact, <a href="https://www.usfoods.com/our-services/business-trends/2019-food-delivery-statistics.html"><strong>70% of all customer complaints</strong></a> with food delivery have to do with mismanaging the quality of service. Thatâ€™s 6 out of 7 people. The most common complaints are the food isnâ€™t warm or fresh enough (17%), the delivery is late (16%), incorrect order (12%), and that customer service ignores notes or instructions (12%).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/3.jpg" alt="food delivery customer complaints" title="food delivery customer complaints"></p>
<ol start="40">
<li>On the other hand, 52% of delivery personnel cite food orders not being ready for pick-up as their biggest complaint.</li>
<li>This doesnâ€™t prevent 79% of consumers choosing delivery over takeout if the restaurant is more than 3km away.</li>
<li>And even <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/705571/average-price-paid-per-food-order-in-the-us/"><strong>34% of consumers</strong></a> usually pay up to $50 per delivery when ordering food online.</li>
<li>Thatâ€™s why <a href="https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/9-in-10-us-food-delivery-service-users-say-it-makes-their-lives-easier"><strong>31% of people</strong></a> in the US use third-party delivery services at least twice per week.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/06/2057928/0/en/Last-Mile-Delivery-is-the-Most-Inefficient-Process-for-More-Than-Half-of-North-American-Transportation-Logistics-Companies.html"><strong>59% of third-party logistics companies</strong></a> in the US believe that last-mile delivery is the most inefficient process in their supply chain.</li>
<li>When it comes to healthcare and pharmacy delivery, only <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40483814/how-capsules-online-pharmacy-is-riding-the-third-wave-of-ecommerce"><strong>1% of the total $275 billion in revenue</strong></a> came from online purchases.</li>
<li>But by 2026, the global ePharmacy market will grow to over <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/epharmacy-market-100238"><strong>$177 billion (17.2% CAGR)</strong></a>. A rise of 643% than the current market value.</li>
