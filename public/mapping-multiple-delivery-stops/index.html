          <p>In this new post, we’ll take a look at manual planning.</p>
<p>You’ll see nine of the biggest reasons why it’s impossible to map multiple stops on your delivery routes without software.</p>
<p>In the end, you’ll understand why automation is the key to modern route planning. Plus, we’ll show you the best solution on the market.</p>
<p>Let’s get started. Here are the 9 biggest challenges to manually planning routes with multiple drop-offs:</p>
<h2 id="1-it-takes-too-much-time">1. It takes too much time.</h2>
<p><a href="https://elogii.com/blog/are-you-still-planning-manually/" title="are you still planning manually routes"><strong>Are you still planning manually</strong></a>?</p>
<p>You or your planners can spend hours mapping routes for drivers.</p>
<p>Even then, chances are you might miss finding the best possible route.</p>
<p>And you have to do it every single day, for every single driver.</p>
<p>The time you spend here could be better used elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="2-it-relies-on-key-individuals">2. It relies on key individuals.</h2>
<p>Manual planning is a complex task.</p>
<p>What seems optimal on the map is often very different in practice. So, not everyone is cut out for it.</p>
<p>Only professionals with a working knowledge of distribution, geography, roads, and the supply chain network can find the most optimal solutions.</p>
<p>Without them, it’s impossible to consider manually routing multiple stops and drop-offs.</p>
<h2 id="3-it-wastes-talent">3. It wastes talent.</h2>
<p>Whether you have an individual or a team in place to plan your routes, their potential is being wasted on this manual, repetitive task.</p>
<p>And it can last for hours.</p>
<p>More often than not, route planners also have to sort and group orders based on service areas or postcodes. And then put together delivery schedules.</p>
<p>All of this takes even more time away from their workday.</p>
<p>Finding the best route is also frustrating work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery.htm#:~:text=Burnout%20is%20a%20state%20of,unable%20to%20meet%20constant%20demands."><strong>Burnout</strong></a> is a serious symptom of the job.</p>
<p>And that can cause professionals to leave their jobs - a potentially severe loss for your organization.</p>
<p>The time, effort, and skills these pros bring to the table would benefit your business more effectively if they were assigned more meaningful tasks.</p>
<p>For example, developing tactics to grow your delivery operations.</p>
<h2 id="4-it-doesnt-support-dynamic-routing">4. It doesn’t support dynamic routing.</h2>
<p>Without automated route planning, your pros need time to re-adjust delivery schedules and create new routes for drivers.</p>
<p>Technically, this makes it almost impossible to assign new deliveries on the go.</p>
<p>This makes you less competitive.</p>
<p>You are unable to improve the delivery offer to meet today’s standards, like <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/same-day-delivery-and-delivery-management-software/"><strong>same-day delivery.</strong></a></p>
<p>What you are left with is trying to focus on your local delivery area.</p>
<p>But even then, you waste valuable resources trying to generate speed and neglecting other aspects of your operations, like drive time or fuel consumption.</p>
<p>So, even if your team can create a new schedule and routes, it will still take them at least an hour to do it.</p>
<p>Add to that the time it takes drivers to make the trip to your supply depot, and fast delivery becomes unsustainable.</p>
<h2 id="5-it-doesnt-support-real-time-visibility">5. It doesn’t support real-time visibility.</h2>
<p>With manual route planning, you can easily lose track of all the moving pieces on the map.</p>
<p>As soon as your drivers set off on their routes, you have no more control over them.</p>
<p>Unless dispatchers keep a constant tab on them, there is no way of knowing where your drivers are or what they are doing.</p>
<p>Even if you regularly check-in with drivers, it’s impossible to assign new tasks without locating everyone on the map first.</p>
<p>And since everything is dynamic, as soon as a call ends drivers have already moved on from their last-known location.</p>
<p>It’s a problem for drivers, too.</p>
<p>Not only does it make their assignments more complicated, but it can also distract them from the road.</p>
<p>That seriously raises the question of their safety.</p>
<p>If something happens to the delivery or the driver en route to drop-off, you have no way of knowing what, why, or where.</p>
<p>And that leads us to the next problem.</p>
<h2 id="6-it-is-difficult-to-revise-failed-or-missed-deliveries">6. It is difficult to revise failed or missed deliveries.</h2>
<p>Mistakes can happen to any delivery.</p>
<p>But without a suitable software solution and visibility over the last mile, it is difficult to efficiently carry out returns.</p>
<p>Without automated <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/reverse-logistics-how-to-turn-failure-into-opportunity/" title="reverse logistics"><strong>reverse logistics</strong></a> capabilities, you have to manually correct those mistakes.</p>
<p>If the customer isn’t home, then the driver can simply return on his way back to the supply depot.</p>
<p>But if an item is damaged, you will have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>contact the driver to get details about the failed delivery;</li>
<li>check the location of other drivers;</li>
<li>find the best driver for the new task;</li>
<li>plan a new route for him;</li>
<li>and then bring the new item to the customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this takes too much time.</p>
<p>During the wait, you risk losing the customers to frustration.</p>
<p>And since small businesses rely on service quality to know <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-compete-with-amazon-delivery/" title="how to compete with Amazon delivery"><strong>how to compete with Amazon</strong></a>, Walmart, and other giants, it’s a risk your company simply shouldn’t take.</p>
<h2 id="7-it-is-difficult-to-scale-operations">7. It is difficult to scale operations.</h2>
<p>As the size and complexity of your delivery grow, you will manage larger fleets, cover greater service areas, and handle more order volumes.</p>
<p>But without the use of technology, it’s difficult for you to use proven <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-tactics-to-grow-operations/" title="delivery tactics to grow your operations"><strong>delivery tactics to grow your operations</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Instead of investing in software, you will either have to train or hire more planners both for existing sites and new service areas.</p>
<p>The larger workload and more staff also mean that the cost of payroll (and overhead) will go up.</p>
<p>And as a result, you will need even more capital to expand operations.</p>
<h2 id="8-it-prevents-the-tracking-of-key-metrics">8. It prevents the tracking of key metrics.</h2>
<p>One of the <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/9-biggest-delivery-challenges-for-ecommerce-and-how-to-solve-them/" title="biggest delivery challenges in ecommerce"><strong>biggest delivery challenges in eCommerce</strong></a> is cost.</p>
<p>Technically, there are also a lot of opportunities to save money through the optimization of last-mile operations.</p>
<p>But that requires you to track <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/7-key-metrics-in-delivery-logistics-to-measure-for-success/"><strong>key metrics in delivery logistics</strong></a>.</p>
<p>With manual planning, this process is difficult.</p>
<p>In fact, keeping track of KPIs by hand can lead to more waste of valuable resources.</p>
<p>For example, if you have to calculate the cost of fuel, drivers would have to keep track of how much fuel their vehicles consume per route.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of vehicles in your fleet, those numbers might be imprecise.</p>
<p>Once they collect the data, planners can process the information for each vehicle and calculate the cost per mile or delivery</p>
<p>And this is only one key parameter you have to consider.</p>
<h2 id="9-it-doesnt-support-advanced-technology">9. It doesn’t support advanced technology.</h2>
<p>Free route planning software solutions are usually limited tools.</p>
<p>In most cases, you can only plan one route at a time.</p>
<p>And again, you have to input information by hand.</p>
<p>For example, if you use Google Maps, you can easily create routes from point A to point B.</p>
<p>But if you have to add more than one stop on your route, things become more complicated.</p>
<p>Plus, Google Maps can only support <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/thread/2792219?hl=en"><strong>up to ten different stops per route</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Not to mention, it doesn&rsquo;t automatically select the most efficient route. You will have to do that by hand, as well.</p>
<p>All of this is a challenge when you have to plan for dozens of routes with multiple destinations.</p>
<p>But there is an answer to all of these problems.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-is-route-optimization-software">The solution is route optimization software.</h2>
<p>A <strong>multiple stop route planner</strong> is an optimization tool.</p>
<p>The main goal is to automatically create routes for drivers around dozens of drop-off locations.</p>
<p>At the same time, the planner adjusts routes for the optimal time, fuel, delivery windows, vehicle capacity, driver’s lunch breaks, and countless other factors.</p>
<p>Modern solutions map out these routes automatically at the click of a button.</p>
<p>And by <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/adopting-the-cloud-first-approach-to-delivery-logistics/" title="adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics"><strong>adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics</strong></a>, anyone on your team can access it from anywhere.</p>
<p>A user-friendly interface also cuts the learning curve in half.</p>
<p>That means that you won’t rely on a handful of pros to plan routes.</p>
<p>Instead, you can train a member from each team to use the software.</p>
<p>And within a matter of days, you can ensure that operations can continue without a hitch even when someone is out of the office.</p>
<p>The best part is that <strong>route optimization software</strong> is just one part of a larger ecosystem.</p>
<p>If you choose <strong>delivery management software</strong>, you can gain access to even more capabilities like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depot planning and management;</li>
<li>Fleet management;</li>
<li>Delivery tracking and monitoring;</li>
<li>Automated delivery scheduling and routing;</li>
<li>Electronic proof of delivery;</li>
<li>Delivery apps for drivers;</li>
<li>Analytics and reporting;</li>
