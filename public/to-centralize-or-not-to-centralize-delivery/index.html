        <div class="content mb-5">
          <p>To centralize or not to centralize your delivery operations?</p>
<p>It’s a hard call to make.</p>
<p>In this post, you’ll see the reasons for a centralized approach to delivery management.</p>
<p>You will see the same for decentralization.</p>
<p>In the end, you’ll have a more well-informed understanding of what each approach can do for your delivery.</p>
<p>So, you can make a better decision for your organization.</p>
<p>Let’s start.</p>
<h2 id="the-question-of-centralization">The question of centralization.</h2>
<p>Centralization and decentralization apply to all business activities.</p>
<p>Technically, every process is determined by one of two paths.</p>
<p>It is <strong>a consolidated approach</strong>.</p>
<p>One that relies on key people to make decisions that shape the processes for the entire organization.</p>
<p>Or, it is <strong>a delegated approach</strong>.</p>
<p>One that leaves the decision making to teams based on their working knowledge and expertise.</p>
<p>Addressing the topic, thought leaders at McKinsey proposed three key questions <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/to-centralize-or-not-to-centralize"><strong>in this article</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>A yes</strong> to at least one opens the road for you to centralize.</p>
<p><strong>A no</strong> to all three and you should dismiss the notion.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/three-questions-for-centralization.png" alt="centralization vs. decentralization" title="Questions for centralization vs. decentralization"></p>
<p><em>Source:</em> <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/"><strong>McKinsey</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="1-is-centralization-mandated-for-your-delivery">1. Is centralization mandated for your delivery?</h3>
<p>A positive answer to this question means you have little choice in the matter.</p>
<p>If you outsource deliveries to a third-party logistics provider, then usually you have one person communicating with that company.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have multiple fleets covering multiple delivery areas, you probably have a manager responsible for each site.</p>
<p>In this situation, centralization is not mandated and the answer is NO.</p>
<h3 id="2-does-centralization-add-significant-value-to-your-delivery">2. Does centralization add significant value to your delivery?</h3>
<p>A significant problem of this question is how to determine value.</p>
<p><strong>The solution is to gain clarity</strong>.</p>
<p>To do this, set a high goal. If it is high enough, the benefits of centralization will clearly outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
<p>The experts at McKinsey suggest asking the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Does the proposed initiative add 10 percent to the market capitalization or profits of the corporation?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if you integrate route optimization software, will this tool reduce the costs of your operations?</p>
<p>Or will it add more overhead?</p>
<p>Will it simplify route planning?</p>
<p>Or complicate the process for everyone involved?</p>
<p>If the answer is negative, there is little room for centralization and you can move on to the next question.</p>
<h3 id="3-are-the-risks-low-for-your-delivery">3. Are the risks low for your delivery?</h3>
<p>More often than not, the value that centralization generates is uncertain.</p>
<p>Or it takes a long time for you to evaluate it.</p>
<p>In this situation, you have to <strong>weigh the risks to your organization</strong>.</p>
<p>If the risks are insignificant, you can carry out the plan to centralize your delivery.</p>
<p>For example, a plan to manage operations <strong>using a delivery management platform</strong> will likely get a positive answer to this question.</p>
<p>You can clearly cut costs if you use one tool instead of a host of disconnected apps.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if that software isn’t compatible with other key software, then the additional resources can be better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p>If you don’t get a YES from at least one question, you should rethink your plan to centralize before moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="a-decentralized-approach-to-delivery-operations">A decentralized approach to delivery operations.</h2>
<p>Each delivery follows different stages in its lifecycle.</p>
<p>And each stage has a different structure, process, and person at the helm.</p>
<p><strong>A decentralized approach to delivery management is grounded on each of those individual parts in your organization.</strong></p>
<p>Every aspect operates independently from the other and within the limits you set. This can be based on:</p>
<h3 id="location">Location</h3>
<p><strong>You manage each delivery area separately.</strong></p>
<p>Each location can receive orders and fulfil them independently from other sites.</p>
<p>It has the infrastructure, fleet of vehicles, depot locations, and workforce in place to complete every stage of the delivery.</p>
<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<p><strong>You manage deliveries stage-by-stage.</strong></p>
<p>At each stage, there are people, infrastructure, equipment, and tools in place to independently carry out specific tasks.</p>
<p>Only when one task is completed (for example an order is received), the process can move forward to the next stage until you fulfil the order.</p>
<h3 id="team">Team.</h3>
<p><strong>You manage deliveries at a team level.</strong></p>
<p>Specialized teams are responsible for completing specific tasks at specific stages of the delivery process.</p>
<p>Each team has a set of goals they have to achieve to fulfil an order.</p>
<p>When you combine their efforts, you can see the results of the organization as a whole.</p>
<hr>
<p>This kind of organizational planning relies a lot on individuals.</p>
<p>Each person is a professional in his or her field of expertise.</p>
<p>That person is also responsible for performing unique tasks and achieving specific results.</p>
<p>For example, a route planner has to plan the best delivery routes for your drivers.</p>
<p>At the same time, he has to address <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/7-key-metrics-in-delivery-logistics-to-measure-for-success/" title="key metrics in delivery logistics"><strong>key metrics in delivery logistics</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If he has to achieve a specific cost per delivery, he will increase route density (number of deliveries per route) to maximize cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>This gives your staff a lot of independence.</strong></p>
<p>Each professional on your team can make decisions and take action based on the best possible outcome for your organization.</p>
<p><strong>The decentralized approach also gives managers and CEOs more freedom to delegate.</strong></p>
<p>Rather than passively waiting for orders, this lets you empower employees to take a proactive role in your organization.</p>
<p>Distributing responsibilities like this will reduce the pressure of managing large scale delivery operations, especially at the enterprise level.</p>
<p><strong>Another benefit is local talent.</strong></p>
<p>Many decentralized organizations hire professionals close to their delivery networks.</p>
<p>Their working knowledge of the local roads and supply chains makes planning deliveries at new sites.</p>
<p><strong>It also makes your organization more flexible</strong>.</p>
<p>Removing the need to train and deploy teams when opening up new networks lets you apply proven <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-tactics-to-grow-operations/" title="delivery tactics to grow your operations"><strong>delivery tactics to grow your operations</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Instead of sending regional managers from your central offices, you can rely on new hires to put your plans into action.</p>
<p>Inadvertently, this cuts the time it takes to bring a new site online.</p>
<p>But despite the benefits, decentralization isn’t without its downsides.</p>
<h2 id="the-disadvantages-of-decentralizing-delivery-operations">The disadvantages of decentralizing delivery operations.</h2>
<p>The disadvantages of a decentralized approach to delivery are closely tied to its benefits.</p>
<p>There are several things you have to consider:</p>
<h3 id="replacing-key-team-members-is-difficult">Replacing key team members is difficult</h3>
<p>Because each professional is hand-selected for his role, finding a substitute isn&rsquo;t simple to achieve.</p>
<p>In case of a long absence due to illness or injury, their extensive experience can turn into a hindrance to day-to-day operations.</p>
<h3 id="on-premise-solutions-prevent-easy-transition">On-premise solutions prevent easy transition</h3>
<p>If you manage each delivery network separately, the software is likely unique to those sites.</p>
<p>In case you have to replace a staffer, the learning curve prevents new employees from their immediate integration into the role.</p>
<h3 id="specific-equipment-is-tied-to-specific-locations">Specific equipment is tied to specific locations</h3>
<p>Because each delivery area is independent, it is difficult for you to consolidate all your assets.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-improve-last-mile-delivery-when-demand-exceeds-your-capacity/" title="when demand exceeds your capacity"><strong>when demand exceeds your capacity</strong></a> at one location, you have to jump through hoops to distribute resources to meet those requirements.</p>
<h3 id="going-nowhere-fast">Going nowhere fast</h3>
<p>The level of expertise of professionals at different locations means they spend most of their time completing basic tasks.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it can be difficult to maintain their morale.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, sending them to new offices means retraining employees to fill their roles at existing sites. In both cases, turnover is suffering.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-control">Lack of control</h3>
<p>Without central oversight and visibility, it is difficult for you to monitor the performance of specific teams.</p>
<p>This can result in inconsistency and inertia at various levels of the delivery process, which can seriously affect the output of your operations.</p>
<p>It also prevents you from applying strategies that drive change across the organization as a whole.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to move on to a different approach.</p>
<h2 id="a-centralized-approach-to-delivery-operations">A centralized approach to delivery operations.</h2>
<p>At its core, <strong>a centralized system is based on consolidation.</strong></p>
<p>Instead of treating each process, person, or structure independently, it combines them into a single more effective whole.</p>
<p>Here, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p><strong>And one central hub is responsible for managing the entire delivery operation.</strong></p>
<p>To do this, centralized deliveries leverage <strong>standardization</strong>, <strong>collaboration</strong>, and <strong>communication</strong> across the entire organization:</p>
<h3 id="all-assets-are-managed-holistically">All assets are managed holistically</h3>
<p>The CEO, operations managers, and team heads have access to the same resources.</p>
<p>You can actively use these resources and distribute them directly to meet the requirements of a specific situation.</p>
<h3 id="all-teams-receive-orders-from-one-place">All teams receive orders from one place</h3>
<p>Because the entire operation relies on one order management systems, planners and schedulers can work together when assigning deliveries to drivers.</p>
<h3 id="all-teams-can-collaborate-on-different-tasks">All teams can collaborate on different tasks.</h3>
<p>Sharing data and resources across teams, stages of delivery and processes make it possible to streamline operations.</p>
<p>If, for example, a vehicle breaks down, managers can quickly find a replacement vehicle or driver to complete the delivery run.</p>
<h3 id="all-teams-have-access-to-the-most-modern-systems">All teams have access to the most modern systems</h3>
<p>Most companies today take this approach because they use modern technology.</p>
<p>Systems like <strong>delivery management software</strong> make it possible to view, review, and assign tasks for maximum impact and the most efficient results.</p>
<h3 id="all-strategies-are-applied-company-wide">All strategies are applied company-wide.</h3>
<p>A centralized approach makes it possible to create, adopt, and evaluate tactics that solve the <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/9-biggest-delivery-challenges-for-ecommerce-and-how-to-solve-them/" title="biggest delivery challenges"><strong>biggest delivery challenges</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In turn, you can optimize operations for maximum performance sooner rather than later.</p>
<h3 id="all-teams-use-the-same-lines-of-communication">All teams use the same lines of communication</h3>
<p>Since strategies and technologies are adopted across the company, it is easier to set up one channel for communication.</p>
<p>This enables information to flow both <strong>top-down</strong> (from management down to staff), and <strong>bottom-up</strong> (from staff to managers).</p>
<p><strong>In taking this approach to delivery management, you can achieve greater consistency both in terms of performance and growth and scalability.</strong></p>
<p>And because everyone is on board, your entire organization is always moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-balance-between-a-centralized-and-decentralized-approach">Is there a balance between a centralized and decentralized approach?</h2>
<p>Yes, there is.</p>
<p>Thanks to disruptive technology, like delivery management software, the game has changed.</p>
<p>Before, small and medium businesses relied on manual planning, while large enterprises could afford to use on-premise solutions.</p>
<p>The lack of suitable solutions meant most companies had to adopt a decentralized approach to their delivery operations.</p>
<p>But today, things are different.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/public-cloud-computing#:~:text=Gartner%20defines%20public%20cloud%20computing,are%20external%20to%20the%20provider's"><strong>Cloud computing</strong></a> has made it possible for SaaS companies to offer <em>quality solutions at the fraction of the cost, and with greater functionality than ever before.</em></p>
<p>Technically, it’s impossible to imagine an operation that isn&rsquo;t <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/adopting-the-cloud-first-approach-to-delivery-logistics/" title="adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics"><strong>adopting a cloud-first approach to delivery logistics</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Inadvertently, this has opened many doors.</p>
<p><strong>Technology has allowed more companies to centralize their operations.</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, it enabled more companies to experiment when finding the approach that works best for their organization.</p>
<p>And in fact, this has led to a fusion.</p>
<p><strong>A company with a centralized delivery operation can now decentralize specific processes using the software.</strong></p>
<p>For example, you can use the same platform to plan, route, and dispatch deliveries for drivers.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, integrated apps for drivers allows them to communicate with customers directly, and independently from the central hub.</p>
<p>This can open your organization to new <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-management-trends/"><strong>delivery management trends</strong></a>, like letting drivers upsell favourite products or services directly to your customers.</p>
<p>And with this third approach, the question is different than before.</p>
<h2 id="to-centralize-or-not-to-centralize-your-delivery">To centralize or not to centralize your delivery?</h2>
<p>That is the question that is on every manager’s mind. It’s what keeps them awake at night.</p>
<p>But that’s not the question you should be asking yourself.</p>
<p>Instead, ask yourself the three questions from the beginning of this post.</p>
<p>A yes to just one can set you on the path to centralization.</p>
<p>Even then, opening a debate with your team can help you to build a strategy that works best for your company.</p>
<p>Create a level playing field for both sides of the argument to strike the ideal balance between centralization and decentralization.</p>
