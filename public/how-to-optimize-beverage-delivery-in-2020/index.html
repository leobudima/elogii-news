        <div class="content mb-5">
          <p>In this guide, you’ll take a look at how to optimize your drink delivery in 2020, from the first to the last mile.</p>
<p>In fact, these techniques will allow you to improve your supply chain, cut costs, so more people buy your beverages.</p>
<p>All thanks to optimization.</p>
<p>What you read here will help you move your offer online.</p>
<p>Reach more customers. And take advantage of new opportunities post coronavirus.</p>
<p>And we’ll walk you through the whole process, one step at a time.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="offer-beverages-beyond-your-physical-store">Offer beverages beyond your physical store.</h2>
<p>The beverage industry is a large and mature market.</p>
<p>When combined, <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/10000000/100/alcoholic-drinks/worldwide"><strong>the revenue of alcoholic drinks</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/20000000/100/non-alcoholic-drinks/worldwide"><strong>the revenue of non-alcoholic drinks</strong></a> is <strong>$2,409,439 million</strong> worldwide.</p>
<p>But unlike food delivery, the online sale and delivery of drinks account for only a fraction of that revenue stream.</p>
<p>In fact, only <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/10000000/100/alcoholic-drinks/worldwide#market-arpu"><strong>2.4% of all beverages are sold online</strong></a>, and only <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-statistics-2020/"><strong>1% of total alcohol sales</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/the-state-of-delivery-in-time-of-the-coronavirus/" title="the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus"><strong>the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus</strong></a> is changing things.</p>
<p>So much, that according to <a href="https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-drinking-alcohol-sales/"><strong>research from Nielsen</strong></a>, online alcohol sales are up <strong>243%</strong>.</p>
<p>This is causing most drink producers and retailers to rethink their offers.</p>
<p>From large distributors to small breweries and organic juice producers, more and more companies are moving their offer online.</p>
<p>Mind you, most of them still do business at their physical stores.</p>
<p>Only now, it also serves as a pick-up point for the delivery of online orders.</p>
<p>But online beverage delivery comes with a few concerns.</p>
<p>The most significant concern among consumers is the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/21/uber-eats-cocktails-coronavirus/"><strong>Washington Post</strong></a>, Uber Eats and their drivers have been delivering cocktails and alcohol without ID’ing or even seeing the customer first.</p>
<p>But those aren’t the only concerns.</p>
<p>If you are to successfully move (at least half of) your sales to the website, it’s necessary to overcome other obstacles associated with delivery and fulfilment.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenges-of-managing-order-fulfilment-of-drinks">The challenges of managing order fulfilment of drinks.</h2>
<p>Delivering drinks is a simple concept.</p>
<p>You receive orders and deliver them from point A to point B.</p>
<p>But once you build a delivery, you realize there it’s much more to it than that.</p>
<p>That’s why delivery and pick-up is a common pain point for business owners.</p>
<p>And solving this pain demands the <strong>ongoing improvement of the delivery process</strong>.</p>
<p>But before you start optimizing, it’s crucial to know what are <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/9-biggest-delivery-challenges-for-ecommerce-and-how-to-solve-them/" title="biggest delivery challenges in online sales"><strong>the biggest delivery challenges</strong></a>:</p>
<h3 id="delivering-drinks-to-customers-has-to-be-fast">Delivering drinks to customers has to be fast.</h3>
<p>Your customers are thirsty.</p>
<p>And it’s your responsibility to quench their thirst as fast as possible.</p>
<p>On the one hand, any type of food and beverage delivery is time-sensitive.</p>
<p>Significant delays can affect the quality of your product.</p>
<p>That’s why you have to speed up your delivery.</p>
<p>After all, it’s what customers want.</p>
<p>If you offer delivery at the local last-mile, it’s important to <strong>start managing in real-time</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This can help you cut time per delivery, so you can handle more deliveries at the fraction of the cost.</strong></p>
<p>If you distribute beverages at a much larger scale, speed can allow you to offer <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/same-day-delivery-and-delivery-management-software/" title="same-day delivery and delivery management software"><strong>same-day delivery</strong></a>.</p>
<p>And that can help you co-exist with much larger competitors, like Amazon, Walmart, or Wholefoods.</p>
<h3 id="ensure-customers-always-get-what-they-want">Ensure customers always get what they want.</h3>
<p>Order allocation is an important part of maintaining <strong>quality control</strong> and <strong>customer experience</strong>.</p>
<p>Allocating orders correctly means delivering the right brand, on the right day, at the right location.</p>
<h3 id="keep-track-of-inventory-if-you-want-to-maintain-stock">Keep track of inventory if you want to maintain stock.</h3>
<p><strong>Tracking inventory relies as much on your supply chain network, as it does monitoring the flow of goods.</strong></p>
<p>When you don’t have a clear view of how many products are moving upstream vs. downstream, you can end up using up all your stock.</p>
<p>If that happens, it is difficult to maintain fulfilment and delivery volumes.</p>
<p>Not to mention, without reliable inventory tracking, you won’t have sufficient insight to <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-improve-last-mile-delivery-when-demand-exceeds-your-capacity/" title="improve last-mile delivery when demand exceeds your capacity"><strong>improve last-mile delivery when demand exceeds your capacity</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 id="raise-visibility-over-the-entire-supply-chain">Raise visibility over the entire supply chain.</h3>
<p>A supply chain has well-defined steps.</p>
<p>It has a start and a finish.</p>
<p>It has the first and the last mile.</p>
<p><strong>That is why looking at the entire process from a wide and a narrow-angle is key to identifying opportunities on how to improve it.</strong></p>
<p>Without a complete overview of all operations, your organization can miss out on key opportunities to optimize.</p>
<p><strong>Visibility is the solution.</strong></p>
<p>It gives you complete control over how you produce, source, and distribute drinks across the entire supply chain network.</p>
<p>In turn, you will have the range to fulfil any order volumes despite the demand.</p>
<h3 id="gain-transparency-over-the-last-mile">Gain transparency over the last-mile.</h3>
<p>Delivery tracking allows you to know the location of every delivery at every moment.</p>
<p>This ensures <strong>a seamless transition from pick-up to drop-off</strong>.</p>
<p>It even lets you share that information with your customers for better customer experience.</p>
<h3 id="communicate-with-your-teams-and-customers-more-effectively">Communicate with your teams and customers more effectively.</h3>
<p>Communication determines the success of each delivery.</p>
<p>Equipping teams with technology that lets them instantly share and access data, allows you to <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/agile-delivery-operations/" title="build an agile delivery operation"><strong>build an agile delivery operation</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It also empowers your staff to extend the line of communication directly to your customers, so they can provide a better service.</p>
<h3 id="analyze-the-performance-of-your-delivery-teams-and-operations">Analyze the performance of your delivery teams and operations.</h3>
<p><strong>Monitoring performance is critical for reducing operational waste.</strong></p>
<p>It helps you find opportunities for optimization.</p>
<p>Measuring <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/7-key-metrics-in-delivery-logistics-to-measure-for-success/"><strong>key metrics in delivery logistics</strong></a> like the average cost per delivery is vital for this process.</p>
<p>Without key performance indicators (KPIs), you won’t be able to make adjustments and test them against benchmarks.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-fast-and-agile-system-that-can-handle-returns">Create a fast and agile system that can handle returns.</h3>
<p>Delivery is an active process.</p>
<p>Despite your best efforts, sometimes things can happen that are out of your control.</p>
<p>For example, a customer may receive the wrong label of spirit.</p>
<p>A pallet of soft-drinks may arrive at the wrong store.</p>
<p>Or a case of wine may be damaged en route to the customer’s restaurant.</p>
<p><a href="https://elogii.com/blog/reverse-logistics-how-to-turn-failure-into-opportunity/" title="reverse logistics"><strong>Reverse logistics</strong></a> helps you overcome all of these issues.</p>
<p>It allows you to turn failure into opportunity, so you can keep costs low while maintaining high customer satisfaction at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="delivery-management-software-can-optimize-drink-delivery-and-pick-up">Delivery management software can optimize drink delivery and pick-up.</h2>
<p>From <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-management-software-for-restaurants-dark-kitchens/"><strong>food delivery for restaurants</strong></a> to field service operations, technology is transforming how businesses manage deliveries.</p>
<p>And software is a key part of that disruption.</p>
<p><strong>But what is delivery management software, exactly?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, it is an end-to-end solution for handling logistics.</p>
<p>It allows you to manage, optimize, and perform all tasks related to your delivery process.</p>
<p>Typically, companies see it as <strong>route optimization software</strong>.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also much more than that.</p>
<p>Yes, it allows you to automatically <strong>plan deliveries around the most efficient routes</strong>.</p>
<p>But it also lets you, for example, <strong>increase the route density of each delivery run</strong>.</p>
<p>Drivers and field agents can handle more drop-offs and, thus, reduce your <strong>cost per delivery</strong>.</p>
<p>It can <strong>minimize drive time per delivery</strong> and <strong>speed up fulfilment</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, companies that deliver time-sensitive orders can ensure the speedy delivery of drinks like <strong>ready-to-order cocktails</strong>.</p>
<p>But delivery management software also allows you to supply beverages to stores, restaurants, and other businesses.</p>
<p>The tool can handle multiple tasks, teams, fleets, and vehicles regardless of size, scale, or order volume.</p>
<p>For example, it can just as easily handle ten fleets of dozens of vehicles, as it can one fleet with only one vehicle.</p>
<p>But it offers many other capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single or multi-depot planning</li>
<li>Task scheduling</li>
<li>Real-time delivery tracking</li>
<li>Vehicle and driver management</li>
<li><a href="https://elogii.com/blog/electronic-proof-of-delivery-epod-how-does-it-improve-logistics-operations/"><strong>Electronic proof of delivery</strong></a></li>
<li>Customer data management</li>
<li>Customer ratings and feedback</li>
<li>Live reporting</li>
<li>Reviewing delivery analytics</li>
<li>And more.</li>
</ul>
<p>With visibility at the operational, as well as the cellular level (task, driver, route, account, or customer), you will never miss an opportunity to evaluate performance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the key to optimization.</p>
<p>And if you are only just now thinking about delivering drinks to customers, it’s time to get started.</p>
<h2 id="2020-is-the-year-to-break-into-drink-delivery">2020 is the year to break into drink delivery.</h2>
<p>Now, it’s your turn.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, this is the year to set up a delivery service.</p>
<p>After all, Henry Ford said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always got.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
