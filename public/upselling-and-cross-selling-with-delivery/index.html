        <div class="content mb-5">
          <p>In this new post, we will show you how to start upselling and cross-selling with delivery.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a myth?</p>
<p>Or has it become a reality?</p>
<p>First, you will take a look at what does it mean to upsell a product, how does it work, and what makes it different from cross-selling.</p>
<p>And, how using both sales tactics benefits your business. (Regardless of the industry you are in)</p>
<p>Then, you’ll see why you should seriously consider upselling and cross-selling your products through delivery.</p>
<p>And how to make it a reality in your company, step by step.</p>
<p>Let’s start.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-upselling">What is upselling?</h2>
<p><strong>Upselling</strong> (or selling-up) is a valuable sales technique to boost profits. It means getting customers to buy the same type of product but at a higher price.</p>
<p>Usually, this is a larger, more feature-rich, or custom version of the product.</p>
<p><em>“Would you like to upgrade to a large order?”</em> is an example of upselling food delivery at restaurants and dark kitchens.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/upselling-example.jpg" alt="example-of-upselling-food-delivery" title="An example of upselling products in food delivery"></p>
<h2 id="what-is-cross-selling">What is cross-selling?</h2>
<p>The lines between upselling and cross-selling are often blurred. So, it’s easy to confuse them. But simply put:</p>
<p><strong>Cross-selling</strong> is a sales strategy that involves getting customers to spend more money on a different product that complements the initial purchase.</p>
<p><em>“Would you like a drink to go with your meal?”</em> would be a cross-selling example at the mentioned food delivery.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/cross-selling-example.jpg" alt="example-of-cross-selling-food-delivery" title="An example of cross-selling in food delivery"></p>
<p>So, what is the difference between an upsell and a cross-sell?</p>
<p><strong>An upsell is a different version of the same product.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And a cross-sell is a completely different product.</strong></p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at why you need to do it.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-cross-selling-and-upselling-important">Why are cross-selling and upselling important?</h2>
<p>Creating upsell and cross-sell offers isn’t a new thing.</p>
<p>For years now, Amazon and other ecommerce stores have been using these tactics on <strong>product pages and at checkout</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/ecommerce-upsell-examples-phone-comparison.jpg" alt="ecommerce-upsell-examples-phone-comparison-amazon" title="An ecommerce upsell example of a phone comparisson on Amazon"></p>
<p><strong>Many other companies consciously create slightly different versions of the same product only to upsell them later.</strong></p>
<p>Think of the difference between an iPhone series model and a Plus version.</p>
<p>The only advantage of a Plus model is the size (and maybe some minor add-ons), while the price is sometimes over $100 higher than the original.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/upsell-price-comparisson.png" alt="upsell-price-comparisson-iphone" title="An upsell price comparison of an Apple iPhones"></p>
<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/"><strong>gsmarena.com</strong></a></p>
<p>And businesses tend to create offers that supplement the original, increasing the order value:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free delivery with every purchase above a certain limit;</strong></li>
<li><strong>A necessary accessory</strong>, like a case for a new smartphone;</li>
<li><strong>A discount with an additional item</strong> (buy one get one at X% off).</li>
</ul>
<p>So it isn’t a question of whether upselling is better than cross-selling, or cross-selling better than upselling.</p>
<p>You should implement both because several key benefits can help you:</p>
<h3 id="improve-customer-retention">Improve customer retention.</h3>
<p><strong>Upselling and cross-selling improve your ability to retain more customers because it helps to resolve their pains more efficiently by recommending better solutions.</strong></p>
<p>Both work in tandem to <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-management-software-and-customer-experience/"><strong>improve the customer’s experience</strong></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>upsells help customers pick out a superior product from your offer;</li>
<li>cross-sells help customers get the most out of their purchase with useful add-ons.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, it makes your company seem more knowledgeable in the eyes of your customers.</p>
<p>And according to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/future-of-cx"><strong>a recent survey</strong></a>, that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Almost <strong>80% of people</strong> feel a knowledgeable service is an important part of a good customer experience.</p>
<h3 id="raise-the-average-order-value-and-customer-lifetime-value">Raise the average order value and customer lifetime value.</h3>
<p><strong>Upselling more expensive items or cross-selling additional goods raises the average value of each order.</strong></p>
<p>So even with fewer sales, the price per order makes up for the difference in profit.</p>
<p>At the same time, this also boosts the lifetime value of your customers.</p>
<p>Selling a more expensive item to a one-time customer means you get the biggest margins from every sale.</p>
<h3 id="generate-more-revenue">Generate more revenue.</h3>
<p>Product recommendations like <strong>upsells and cross-sells drive more revenue</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, research suggests that it accounts for <a href="https://blog.boldcommerce.com/how-to-use-cross-sells-and-upsells-to-increase-revenue-on-shopify"><strong>10-30% of eCommerce revenue</strong></a>.</p>
<p>And it’s a more cost-effective way to raise profit.</p>
<p>It provides much better returns on your lead generation and customer acquisition efforts since it raises the price per sale of every successful conversion.</p>
<h3 id="gain-a-competitive-advantage">Gain a competitive advantage.</h3>
<p>Knowing <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-compete-with-amazon-delivery/"><strong>how to compete with Amazon</strong></a>, Walmart, Google, Apple, and other retail giants relies on your ability to co-exist with them.</p>
<p>So, it stands to reason that replicating their tactics levels the playing field and helps keep you in the game.</p>
<p>Many small-to-medium businesses <strong>cross-sell and upsell with Shopify</strong>.</p>
<p>But adding such offers shouldn’t stop at checkout on your web store.</p>
<p>You should actively seek out new opportunities to raise your sales effectiveness. And doing it right on your customers’ doorstep is one such possibility.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-you-cross-sell-and-upsell-during-delivery">Why should you cross-sell and upsell during delivery?</h2>
<p><strong>Customers are more likely to decide on cross-sell or upsell offers during delivery.</strong></p>
<p>This rests on at least a couple of things.</p>
<p>First, customers value human interaction.</p>
<p>If your delivery drivers make a good first impression, customers are willing to let their guard down, listen to your delivery agents, and trust what they have to say.</p>
<p>As a result, customers are far more prepared to buy into a cross-sell or upsell pitch, especially if the delivery agent is capable of <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-closing-techniques-and-why-they-work"><strong>closing a sale</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The other reason why cross-selling and upselling during delivery works is because you offer it when the customer has already made a purchase.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the hardest part is over.</p>
<p>You have completed the sale, the customer has paid, and now he no longer has any objections about doing business with your company.</p>
<p>If your delivery agent comes to the customer with a superior product at a slightly higher price or a different product that instantly raises the value of their purchase, he will be inclined to consider the new offer.</p>
<p>And when the customer weighs the difference in cost against the benefits of the new purchase, they seem many times lower than when he compares two products at checkout.</p>
<p>This makes your customers far more likely to accept upsell or cross-sell offers during delivery.</p>
<p>It’s also one of the main reasons cross-selling and upselling through delivery is one of the new <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-management-trends/" title="trends in delivery management 2020"><strong>trends in delivery management in 2020</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at how you can do it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-upsell-and-cross-sell-products-through-delivery">How to upsell and cross-sell products through delivery?</h2>
<p>In this section, you’ll see how to get started with upselling and cross-selling products through delivery.</p>
<p>We’ll walk you through key factors that affect upsell and cross-sell offers.</p>
<p>Not to mention, how to handle inventory and operations, and how to execute all of these tactics to perfection.</p>
<p>In the end, you’ll have a better understanding of how to get it done, step by step. Here’s what you need to do:</p>
<h3 id="1-decide-when-to-upsell-or-cross-sell">1. Decide when to upsell or cross-sell</h3>
<p><strong>Effective upselling and cross-selling is all about timing.</strong></p>
<p>If the timing is off, you risk upsetting your customers, since <a href="https://www.energise.co.nz/blog/website-help/up-selling-visitors-to-your-ecommerce-website/"><strong>40% of people are aware of these sales tactics</strong></a>.</p>
<p>So, first thing first, you need to decide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who do you want to upsell and cross-sell to?</strong> (customers (B2C) vs. businesses (B2B) vs. both; all vs. initial vs. recurring vs. long-time customers)</li>
<li><strong>Where do you want to upsell and cross-sell?</strong> (the local last-mile vs. national or international delivery)</li>
<li><strong>When do you want to offer upsells and cross-sells?</strong> (before or during the drop-off; with a specific type of delivery like free home delivery or priority shipping; on certain days, or during seasonal sales events)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-decide-what-products-to-upsell-or-cross-sell">2. Decide what products to upsell or cross-sell</h3>
<p>Once you have a clear strategy when you want to offer upsells and cross-sells, you now have to decide what they are.</p>
<p>And while your offer could include the entire product catalogue, it’s best to do some testing first.</p>
<p><strong>With upselling, start with your best-sellers and move forward from there.</strong></p>
<p>If your customers are stuck on those products, try recommending that they buy two or more of them at a discount.</p>
<p><strong>With cross-selling, start matching different accessories to corresponding products.</strong></p>
<p>For example, if you operate a beverage delivery, you can start to cross-sell pints with variety 12-packs, or taps with draught beer.</p>
<p>After a certain period, you can change the offers and move on to test your other products.</p>
<h3 id="3-test-and-analyze-customer-data">3. Test and analyze customer data</h3>
<p>When creating upsell and cross-sell offers, it’s critical to take some time to <strong>evaluate consumer data</strong>.</p>
<p>This might be useful for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, it helps you identify the right customers for the pitch.</p>
<p><strong>Targeting returning customers might prove more lucrative since they have a history of doing business with your delivery.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, according to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Metrics-Definitive-Measuring-Performance/dp/0137058292"><strong>Marketing Metrics</strong></a>, the authors point out that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The probability of selling to a new prospect is 5-20%. The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70%.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/probability-of-upselling-cross-selling-groove.jpg" alt="probability-of-upselling-cross-selling-groove" title="The probability of selling to new prospects vs. existing customers"></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/support/upsells"><strong>Groove</strong></a></p>
<p>You can also use data to track movement on your website, including purchase trends.</p>
<p>This can help you to <strong>detect key products your customers consider before checkout</strong>, which may be a good upsell or cross-sell opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="4-adjust-your-supply-chain-and-inventory">4. Adjust your supply chain and inventory</h3>
<p>Without the ability to track and monitor orders and compare them to stock, depots get depleted quickly.</p>
<p>Drivers end up leaving for their routes with empty vans.</p>
<p>And they miss out on a chance to pitch offers to customers.</p>
<p>So before you start upselling and cross-selling through delivery, you need to <strong>adjust the supply chain and align it with your inventory</strong>.</p>
<p>This will allow you to maintain stock even <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-improve-last-mile-delivery-when-demand-exceeds-your-capacity/" title="when demand exceeds your capacity"><strong>when demand exceeds your capacity</strong></a>.</p>
<p>First, you will either have to <strong>increase the supply orders</strong>, <strong>the supply order frequency</strong>, or <strong>the rate of production</strong>.</p>
<p>So you will need to consolidate all of your supply vendors to efficiently manage storage, as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, you will also have to evaluate key sites in the supply chain network.</p>
<p>This means choosing between <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-effectively-plan-your-deliveries-planning-at-a-depot-level-vs-centralized-multi-depot-planning/" title="planning at a depot level vs multi-depot planning"><strong>planning at a depot level vs. centralized multi-depot planning</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Once you cover all of these points, you stock your vehicles full of products.</p>
<p>So not only will your drivers be able to upsell and cross-sell products, but you will be one step closer to <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/agile-delivery-operations/" title="building an agile delivery operation"><strong>building an agile delivery operation</strong></a> with storage on wheels to boot.</p>
<h3 id="5-equip-and-train-drivers-and-delivery-agents">5. Equip and train drivers and delivery agents</h3>
<p>As mentioned, analyzing data helps you create better upsell and cross-sell offers.</p>
<p>But collecting customer data helps your drivers seal the deal at the door, as well.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elogii.delivery.mobile&amp;hl=en_IN"><strong>a driver app</strong></a> gives drivers access to vital customer information.</p>
<p>They can use that data to craft a personalized sales pitch and persuade customers to buy the upsell or cross-sell product.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/delivery_app.png" alt="driver-app-for-delivery" title="A driver app showing customer information by eLogii.com"></p>
<p>But this still might not be enough to close a sale.</p>
<p>So, you should free up some resources to train your delivery agents in successful sales tactics, or start hiring solid drivers with a background in sales.</p>
<h3 id="6-integrate-a-delivery-management-solution">6. Integrate a delivery management solution</h3>
<p>Upselling and cross-selling products during delivery depends on full control and visibility over every part of your operation.</p>
<p>From the moment a customer checks out his purchase, to when a driver pitches the new product at his door, you need to have insight into every task and process before your drivers can start closing deals.</p>
<p>That requires a holistic approach to delivery management.</p>
<p>So, relying on a host of disconnected apps can’t cut it. Instead, you have to integrate an end-to-end solution, like <strong>delivery management software</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Taking a platform approach to delivery management lets you plan, manage and review orders, supplies, inventory, and the fulfilment process all on one dashboard.</strong></p>
<p>Software solutions like these use APIs to integrate with any other system or app, like your website or your Shopify account.</p>
<p>This makes it easier for you to build on what you have, and upsell or cross-sell both online and live.</p>
<p>The tool can seamlessly handle dozens of tasks, orders, deliveries, vehicles, fleets, drivers, teams, and routes, all the while <strong>optimizing each part of the operation for maximum efficiency</strong>.</p>
<p>This means drivers spend less time focusing on how to get to your customer, and more time on how to best sell them your products.</p>
<p>Plus, delivery management software offers other great features as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single or multi-depot planning</li>
<li>Task scheduling</li>
<li>Real-time delivery tracking</li>
<li>Vehicle and driver management</li>
<li>Electronic proof of delivery</li>
<li>Customer data management</li>
<li>Customer ratings and feedback</li>
<li>Live reporting</li>
<li>Reviewing delivery analytics</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-start-upselling-and-cross-selling-your-products">7. Start upselling and cross-selling your products</h3>
<p>Are you ready to start with upselling and cross-selling to customers with delivery?</p>
<p>Remember, successful upsells and cross-sells are all about good timing.</p>

<p>But with product recommendations at the customers’ door, it will be easier to pitch the right upsells and cross-sells at the right time and to the right customer who will act on that offer.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
