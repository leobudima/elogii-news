        <div class="content mb-5">
          <p>Supplying medicine and medical equipment to consumers is a time-sensitive process.</p>
<p>Any delay in the supply chain has a serious impact on the health of your customers.</p>
<p>If anything, the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has exposed the risks in 2020. And the consequences if something doesn’t change.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll show you the importance of uninterrupted pharmacy delivery and how to reach that goal.</p>
<p>We’ll also reveal a solution that can help you overcome all of the challenges of managing pharmacy delivery.</p>
<p>(But more on that later)</p>
<p>Right now, let&rsquo;s take a look at the first step that you need to take.</p>
<h2 id="move-your-storefront-online">Move your storefront online.</h2>
<p>If <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/the-state-of-delivery-in-time-of-the-coronavirus/" title="the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus"><strong>the state of delivery in time of the coronavirus</strong></a> has shown us anything, it’s that there is a genuine need for a contactless purchase of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.</p>
<p>Pharmacies have to allow customers to buy and refill prescription medication without stepping foot outside of their homes.</p>
<p>After all, it’s the only way social distancing is going to work.</p>
<p>But this disruption in the pharma industry had started even before the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>In fact, companies like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-capsule-pharmacy-and-its-medicine-delivery-app-2016-5"><strong>Capsule</strong></a> had started offering consumers a chance to order their medicine online with same-day delivery in New York as early as 2016.</p>
<p>The initial success of the start-up prompted titans like Walgreens and CVS to establish online platforms, as well.</p>
<p>While Amazon entered the market with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/why-amazon-bought-pillpack-for-753-million-and-what-happens-next.html"><strong>the acquisition of PillPack</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Still, customers remained reluctant to order a valuable commodity like prescription drugs online.</p>
<p>That’s why before 2020, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40483814/how-capsules-online-pharmacy-is-riding-the-third-wave-of-ecommerce"><strong>only 1% of the total $275 billion</strong></a> in revenue that Pharmacy generates came from an online purchase.</p>
<p>But the trend is changing in favour of ePharmacy.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to know <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-compete-with-amazon-delivery/" title="how to compete with Amazon delivery"><strong>how to compete with Amazon delivery</strong></a>, Walgreens, CVS, and the likes, moving your storefront online is a key step in the process.</p>
<p>It’s also what your customers want.</p>
<p>Customers want the convenience of online shopping with immediate access to the purchase via a pharmacy delivery service.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly what you need to do next.</p>
<h2 id="offer-pharmacy-delivery-to-your-customers">Offer pharmacy delivery to your customers.</h2>
<p>Pharmacy delivery isn’t a new concept.</p>
<p>Community pharmacies and other small independent pharmacies have offered home delivery of medicine for as long as pharmacies have existed.</p>
<p>You too have probably delivered prescription medication to a loyal customer who is old or disabled at some point in time.</p>
<p>But by modern standards, this was only a small portion of the market.</p>
<p>These days, pharmacy delivery is the norm, and demand for it is growing at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>So much, in fact, that those same small independent pharmacies are finding it difficult to offer fast on-demand delivery with their existing business process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s a quick guide if you want to know <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/how-to-improve-last-mile-delivery-when-demand-exceeds-your-capacity/" title="how to improve last-mile delivery when demand exceeds your capacity"><strong>how to improve last-mile delivery when demand exceeds your capacity</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And let’s face it, delivery isn’t a cheap operation.</p>
<p>So, the question comes to mind: <strong>is pharmacy delivery profitable?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is YES, absolutely.</p>
<p>Like in retail or food delivery, your customers want convenience from their shopping experience.</p>
<p>And while it was easier for them to adopt home delivery of clothes and meals, the COVID-19 situation is helping consumers realize the same is true when it comes to their medicine.</p>
<p>For many consumers, online pharmacy delivery is fast-becoming as convenient as any other purchase delivery if not more so, especially when compared to visiting a brick-and-mortar store.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/epharmacy-market-100238"><strong>statistics forecasts</strong></a> support this. By 2026, the global ePharmacy market size will grow to over <strong>$177 billion with a CAGR of 17.2%</strong>.</p>
<p>And if measures to stop the coronavirus pandemic as social distancing persist, pharmacy delivery will remain the only way you will be able to reach your customers.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to pay attention to what your customers want to get out of doing business with you.</p>
<h2 id="focus-on-customers-remains-important">Focus on customers remains important.</h2>
<p>The pharma industry has always been consumer-centric.</p>
<p><strong>Changing consumer behaviour is making it easier for small independent pharmacies to compete, despite the pressure from large enterprises.</strong></p>
<p>First, consumers want choice when it comes to sourcing medicine.</p>
<p>Most people want to decide (with the help of their doctors) what type of medication they want to consume.</p>
<p><strong>This is prompting consumers to turn away from generic or brand-name drugs to more quality products.</strong></p>
<p>Pharmacies that can offer them will have the upper hand over their competitors.</p>
<p>In most cases, that means you can dedicate a lot more time and resources to provide a higher level of care.</p>
<p>It also means you can create high-trust relationships with your customers, making your services much more reliable (including pharmacy delivery).</p>
<p>Not to mention, this lets you <strong>anticipate the requirements of consumers.</strong></p>
<p>For example, it lets you track and control inventory by aligning it to the supply chain.</p>
<p>That is becoming increasingly important when you want to maintain a reliable service, especially after the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>You can also listen to your customers' pains and desires much easier than larger suppliers.</p>
<p>You can survey customers and incorporate services that customers truly want, such as <strong>ePharmacy platforms</strong> and <strong>home delivery</strong>.</p>
<p>And when it comes to pharmacy delivery, it’s a fantastic opportunity to grow your business.</p>
<p>That said, creating and maintaining a profitable delivery isn’t an easy task, and it doesn’t come without its challenges.</p>
<h2 id="understand-the-difficulties-of-managing-pharmacy-delivery">Understand the difficulties of managing pharmacy delivery.</h2>
<p>The sudden spike in demand for pharmacy delivery is putting pressure on companies to introduce it as part of their service.</p>
<p>While it’s a great opportunity to generate revenue, you and I know it’s much more difficult than that.</p>
<p>To truly succeed, you will need to understand that pharmacy delivery depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Delivering medicine has to be fast. Significant delays can have major consequences on your customers’ health;</li>
<li><strong>Order allocation:</strong> A lot depends on your ability to ensure your customers receive the right brand of medicine, on the right day, and according to their doctor’s prescription;</li>
<li><strong>Inventory monitoring:</strong> Keeping track of inventory (to maintain stock) is a complex process that requires diligence in how you manage your supply chain. But it’s necessary if you want a reliable delivery service;</li>
<li><strong>Supply chain visibility:</strong> the complexity of supply chains in the pharma industry means you have to maintain control over how you source and deliver medicine across the entire network;</li>
<li><strong>Delivery transparency:</strong> both you and your customers have to know the location of every single delivery at any given moment to ensure a seamless transition from pick-up to drop-off;</li>
<li><strong>Delivery accuracy:</strong> Inaccurate delivery prevents you from providing a reliable delivery service. It also has a negative impact on customer satisfaction, as well as your cost-to-revenue balance;</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> How well you can communicate with your delivery team and with customers, determines the success of each drop-off. You have to create a seamless flow of data internally, yet extend the line of communication between delivery agents and customers;</li>
<li><strong>Measuring</strong> <a href="https://elogii.com/blog/7-key-metrics-in-delivery-logistics-to-measure-for-success/"><strong>key metrics in delivery logistics</strong></a>: Tracking and monitoring the performance of your delivery is vital if you want to maintain efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The only way to do that is to analyze key performance indicators of delivery logistics;</li>
<li><strong>Reverse logistics:</strong> Despite your best efforts, mistakes can still happen. Creating a fast and agile system that can overcome those issues will help you keep costs low and customer experience high.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you overcome each of these challenges (and raise your delivery operations to another level), you will need to turn to technology for the answer.</p>
