**_Unimasters chooses eLogii, the leading next-generation Delivery Management platform to introduce fully interactive, dynamic planning and route optimisation in the first and last mile_**

Unimasters has chosen eLogii, the leading next-generation [**Delivery Management**](https://elogii.com/blog/what-is-delivery-management-software/ "delivery management software") and [**Route Optimisation**](https://elogii.com/blog/guide-to-route-optimization-software/ "route optimization software") solution to replace static with fully dynamic delivery tour planning. 

**The result** will be in significantly reduced tour numbers in their first and last-mile operations and greatly enhanced efficiency.

[**Unimasters**](https://www.unimasters.com/en_US/ "Unimasters") is an advanced supply chain management company with regional infrastructure and global reach through first-class partners in **178 countries**. 

The company provides **managed transportation** and **logistics-as-a-service** to a wide range of multinational and local customers.

Unimasters had trialled a number of solutions with the aim of moving to fully dynamic planning, improving delivery accuracy, saving processing time and driving improved customer service and had struggled to find a solution with the combination of flexibility, configurability and scalability that it needed.

With eLogii’s powerful [**SaaS solution**](https://elogii.com/platform "delivery management platform saas"), Unimasters is now able to have complete, dynamic control over pickup and delivery operations, including **automated planning** (taking into account all relevant operational parameters) and **route optimisation** of first and last mile, while providing **total visibility** for both their operations teams and their customers.

According to [**Nikolai Bozhilov**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolai-bozhilov-0b11643/?originalSubdomain=bg "Nikolai Bozhilov"), **_Executive Chairman of Unimasters Logistics Plc_**: 

> “We have been extremely impressed with the capabilities of the eLogii solution, as well as the value for money that the solution provides. The solution is enterprise-grade, but our teams find it as easy to use as consumer software. We forecast significant savings, as well as a materially enhanced customer experience which is why we are looking forward to a strong multi-year partnership together.”

Following the partnership with Unimaster, [**Andrew Mukerjee**](), **_Founder and CEO of eLogii/Brisqq said_**:

> “Enterprise-grade logistics software doesn’t have to be so difficult to use or overpriced – we have the most user-friendly, cost-effective solution in the market, which we will build into the market standard when it comes to Delivery Management.” 

He continued by complimenting the decision, saying:

> “Unimasters is an extremely forward-thinking business which always puts the customer first, and we are looking forward to supporting their growth by enabling a phenomenal customer experience for years to come”.
