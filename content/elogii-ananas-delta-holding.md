**Ananas has chosen eLogii, the leading next generation last-mile optimization solution to drive visibility and control as it rapidly scales operations across the Balkan region over the coming years.**

[**eLogii**](https://elogii.com/) is the leading route optimisation, planning and execution platform for delivery and field services organisations.

**Ananas** is a subsidiary of [**Delta Holdings**](https://www.deltaholding.rs/home.html), a leading diversified holding company with revenues in excess of €500m. Ananas is building a regional platform for online commerce - initially targeting the Serbian market and expanding into other markets of former Yugoslavia as well as Albania. Parent group Delta holdings has committed €100m in investments to the Ananas platform development over the next five years.

Ananas will be distinguished by an extremely large assortment of goods across several categories, in cooperation with thousands of suppliers and merchants, and also by delivering a completely innovative and new user experience to the Balkan’s customers.

eLogii will enable Ananas to track, manage and optimize their [**last-mile operations**](https://elogii.com/blog/last-mile-delivery-guide/) in real-time with eLogii’s optimisation engine automatically creating the most efficient routes, taking into consideration a broad variety of operational constraints.

Customer notifications and tracking will be powered by eLogii’s proprietary technology providing unparalleled visibility and a transformed experience for customers.

Customer convenience is at the heart of the Ananas mission and the flexibility of the eLogii solution seamlessly enables scheduled deliveries, postponing deliveries as well as handling re-routing / re-direction.

Beyond delivery, the eLogii solution will also be powering the rapid scale-up of a PUDO partner network for Ananas, enabling end-to-end visibility across the entire lifecycle of a package. The Ananas PUDO network, a regional first, will provide for step-change in customer experience at scale - allowing flexibility to pick up and return goods at a time convenient to the customer.

According to [**Felipe Alves**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipepintoalves/), Chief Operating Officer of Ananas, a former Partner at BCG and leader of Mercado Libre’s Mercado Envios business: 

_“We looked at a number of last-mile platforms on the market and few had the capabilities to handle the level of scale we require and provide the level of customer experience we are looking to give our shoppers. Furthermore, the flexibility of the platform allows us to seamlessly handle distribution as well as PUDO use cases out of the box – that’s something truly unique in the market. We are excited to partner with eLogii as we scale Ananas into the online commerce platform of the Western Balkans over the coming years”._

[**Andrew Mukerjee**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-mukerjee-93246822/) – founder and CEO of eLogii said: 

_“Ananas have all the ingredients to build the unquestioned online commerce leader in the Western Balkan region. The passion that the Ananas team have for customer experience is amazing and many businesses could learn from it – every detail is covered with the customer always in front of mind. We are delighted to support Ananas by providing unparalleled visibility and control over the last mile of their operations”._
